      "Original sentence: No one, in all honesty, would go to the best picture Oscar list for a defining rundown of the best American cinema. Too many short-shelf life films get through the voting process and rise to the top: Crash? A Beautiful Mind? Really? Middling-to-decent tends to triumph. Actual dyed-in-the-wool classics are rare: The Deer Hunter and The Godfather, and possibly No Country for Old Men and Birdman, are among the only highlights of the past five decades., Then there’s The Sting (1973). Made at the crest of the Hollywood new wave, it may not be freighted with the state-of-American-society themes that weighted Coppola’s or Cimino’s films, nor the embedded cynicism that have made the Coens and Alejandro González Iñárritu beloved in a later cinematic era. But The Sting is the most purely enjoyable film in Oscar history – and that, I think, puts it in the most valuable American film-making tradition of all., First and foremost, The Sting is simply a great caper movie. It wasn’t the first, of course – the convoluted-robbery film was a popular genre throughout the 1960s – but it’s got to be the most complicated brainteaser ever to reach blockbuster and major awards status. In fact, it disproves the idea that popular movies have to be dumb maybe it’s just a peculiarity of the caper genre, but The Sting is as knotty as a differential equation. Its two-part narrative structure – first the card game on the train in which Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) outmanoeuvres nasty Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) and then the betting-office scam that ends with Hooker (Robert Redford) and Gondorff getting plugged – pleasingly follows the pattern of the old bait-and-switch itself. , The elaborate skill of the main scam – “the wire” – is still a delight, nearly 40 years on. It’s a beautifully stage-managed sequence, as Gondorff and Hooker exploit the time delay of the ticker-tape machine (cutting-edge tech in the mid-30s, you presume). As with Argo, Now You See Me and Ocean’s Eleven, The Sting has a sense of the pleasure of a skilfully delivered performance (I’m personally enamoured of Tom Spratley’s “Me specialty’s an Englishman”). There is something about the pride in actorly craftsmanship, underlying cinema’s fondness for cons, stunts and heists. , And The Sting doesn’t neglect to deal with suspension-of-disbelief issues. Cruder films would have had Hooker and Gondorff high-fiving each other as Lonnegan looked on, appalled, but The Sting inserts a final coup de grace – the row, the shooting – that is necessary to get Lonnegan out of the building with no possibility of revenge. But it’s so adroitly done that, until you know for sure, it looks as if Hooker and Gondorff might actually be going at it for real. , Some of the film’s brilliancies are purely decorative. That instantly identifiable theme, for example – Scott Joplin by way of Marvin Hamlisch – is still one of the all-time earworms, and I always find it funny that, despite all the chalkstripe suits and carefully titled caps, the film still looks more like the 1970s than the 1930s. Plus, it’s got one of the great movie bromances in Redford and Newman, one refreshingly free of machismo and manly bluster. The pair had already established their double act in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid four years earlier. It was a triple act if you include the director George Roy Hill, with whom they were reunited on The Sting, and who seems to have inexplicably fallen from critical attention in subsequent years., But best of all, The Sting is a wonderfully moral movie – if that’s not a contradiction in terms for a story of rank deception. It’s more than a simple display of distraction-technique fireworks there is sensitive narrative drama at the heart of the film. These are the deadbeat little guys banding together and putting one over on the vicious, flint-hearted, mean-minded man at the top. (Suddenly, it feels very topical.) Modern cinema could learn a lot.\n"

      "Does pop culture science fiction merely reflect humanity’s hopes and fears for the future, or can it act as an early warning signal designed to help us avoid the impending techno-apocalypse? It’s hard to imagine anyone ever handing over the nuclear codes to a super-intelligent machine after watching James Cameron’s Terminator films, while movies such as Ex Machina and Blade Runner – and TV shows such as Humans and Westworld – might just make us think twice about the ethics of developing artificial lifeforms merely to satisfy cruel sexual appetites. , If there is a cultural hive mind in place doing its best to help humanity avoid self-destruction in 2017, it appears to be rapidly shifting towards Defcon 1. For this year’s crop of movies is dominated by darkling, sombre and often downright sinister entries: stories in which humans find themselves threatened by otherworldly forces, whether extraterrestrial monstrosities or techno-doppelgangers who can do everything we can do, only better. There is fear everywhere – a sign of the times, perhaps. Even Pixar’s big movie of 2017 is about dead people., There are cheerier entries, of course. Marvel looks likely to continue its box office reign with fantastical tales of interstellar talking rodents, Norse gods and a certain gravity-defying teenage crimefighter. Space opera will continue its comeback with a new Star Wars movie proper and Luc Besson’s first foray into the genre since The Fifth Element (1997). But, in general, the outlook for Hollywood in 2017 is distinctly gloomy. Without further ado, here are my top tips – and a few to avoid., Rupert Sanders’ Ghost in the Shell already feels terribly compromised: a whitewashed cast, a middling director best known for insipid fantasy misfire Snow White and the Huntsman and hints in the trailer that the unsettling visions of humanity’s impending fusion with machines, offered by Mamoru Oshii’s seminal 1995 anime, have been swapped out for a load of tired Hollywood tropes about hidden, forgotten identities. It arrives in March. For a more thoughtful examination of the perils of future technology, James Ponsoldt’s The Circle (based on Dave Eggers’ novel about a company that uses technology to oversee all aspects of human existence) might be worth a look the following month., Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant will hope to rediscover the sense of infernal dread that cut through the original slasher-in-space like a knife, while tying up some of the loose ends that made predecessor Prometheus such an ultimately frustrating affair. What happened to Noomi Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw? Why is Michael Fassbender’s devious David the android now living alone on his planet-wide bachelor pad of evil, and why do the race of Engineers so hate humanity that they keep cooking up new forms of acid-spewing creatures from the seventh layer of Hades to violate us in increasingly awful fashion? Get ready to scream into the cosmos in May. , Is the Planet of the Apes reboot really into its third movie? War for the Planet of the Apes will see Andy Serkis’s meticulously rendered mo-cap primate Caesar taking on Woody Harrelson’s Colonel for control of the post-apocalyptic Earth, and there’s surely no finer actor than the latter for essaying psychopathic intensity. Matt Reeves’ second stint in the director’s chair debuts in July. , It should come as no surprise that Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 looks set to be an even grimmer tale than Scott’s original 1982 dystopian masterpiece. The debut teaser does at least suggest that Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard lived rather longer than his replicant brothers and sisters – a development that will need to be explained – but future Los Angeles’ jaded cityscapes remain clouded in an eternal dusk, and even the once glorious Tyrell pyramid appears to have been swallowed by the desert. New blade runner Ryan Gosling begins his mission to save a world that already looks pretty screwed in October., It’s also worth mentioning a pair of thrillers set in space. God Particle, from newcomer Julius Onah, is the third instalment in the very-loosely-connected-indeed Cloverfield saga, following on from last year’s sinister 10 Cloverfield Lane. This time the aftermath of the monster attack on New York finds us in a space station floating above Earth, as an international crew of astronauts tries to work out why the planet beneath them appears to have suddenly vanished. The film debuts in October., On a similar tip, Daniel Espinosa’s Life will see International Space Station astronauts Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Ryan Reynolds grapple with the discovery of a mysterious sample taken from the surface of Mars that might hold the key to proving the existence of extraterrestrial life. That one arrives in March., The remarkable success of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story suggests audiences continue to be inspired by movies straddling the divide between science fiction and fantasy. Throw in the quick-fire inter-superhero badinage of Marvel’s Avengers films and you have James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, which is due a second outing in May. The comedy highlight this time around is expected to be Vin Diesel’s Baby Groot, who has regressed to infancy after the events of the first film and now boasts a toddler-esque penchant for mischief. , Who knows if Star Wars’ resurgence inspired Besson to return to the genre that ushered in perhaps his greatest triumph more than two decades after The Fifth Element debuted in cinemas, in the supremely ambitious-looking Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. What is certain is that the French fantasy maestro is taking a galaxy-sized risk punting €180m (£153m, the biggest ever budget for a French film) on Cara Delevingne delivering a better performance than she did in the execrable Suicide Squad. , Delevingne plays Laureline, partner to Dane DeHaan’s time-and space-travelling super agent: in the long-running graphic novels, she emerges as the series’ real star. Fingers crossed the film succeeds by injecting some Gallic whimsy into the genre and doesn’t go the same way as that other well-intentioned but ultimately failed attempt to expand the template, the Wachowskis’ Jupiter Ascending. Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets debuts in July., Finally, the big one: Rian Johnson’s still-untitled Star Wars: Episode VIII. Will we finally discover the truth about Rey’s mysterious past? Can Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker – this will be our first chance to see the galaxy’s last living Jedi knight in action since 1983 – still cut it with a lightsaber? And how will Disney go about giving Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia a suitable – preferably non-CGI-assisted – send-off? We’ll find out in mid-December., With comic book movies having shifted into grown-up territory, The Lego Batman Movie is probably the only superhero film suitable for small children out this year. Fortunately, Chris McKay’s film looks set to have the beating of most of its contemporaries, thanks largely to Will Arnett’s wonderfully tongue-in-cheek turn as the tiny, plastic, lobster thermidore-munching caped crusader. It’s a follow-up to 2014 smash hit The Lego Movie, and it’s out next month. What a pity Power Rangers, to be released in March, appears to have eschewed a similar meta-infused approach for a gloomy, furrow-browed adaptation of the brilliantly super-kitsch TV show., There’s no X-Men movie out this year, but James Mangold’s Logan, featuring Hugh Jackman in his (supposedly) final turn as an older, weakened Wolverine, should fill the gap nicely. Quite how influenced the movie will be by Mark Millar’s classic graphic novel Old Man Logan remains to be seen. There are hints it may be closely influenced by more recent Marvel comics in which a female clone of Wolverine, X-23, takes over the adamantium-clawed mutant’s role. Logan arrives in March. , The new, Warner Bros-funded DC Expanded Universe has two episodes out in 2017. Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman arrives first, in March, and will hope to give the film series an Amazonian kick up the backside after the disastrous double whammy of Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The latter’s director, Zack Snyder, promises he’s learned from his mistakes and will give us a more sympathetic Batfleck in November’s Justice League. If neither film achieves critical traction, it’s hard to see how future efforts such as The Flash and Aquaman can be expected to drive all before them., Rival studio Marvel is also doubling up this year. Spider-Man: Homecoming, out in July, will see Tom Holland’s callow wall-crawler earning his superhero stripes as Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man looks on proudly in between dodgy cracks about the continuing attractiveness of Marisa Tomei’s evergreen Aunt May. Then in November we get the return of Chris Hemsworth’s Norse hunk Thor for a Planet Hulk-inspired road trip through the cosmos in the rumoured company of Mark Ruffalo’s not-so-jolly green giant and Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. There are also reports that Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange could be along for the ride. , Due in June, The Mummy is a strange beast. It looks like a typical Tom Cruise action movie of the past decade, as he is joined once again by an attractive younger female companion (this time Annabelle Wallis) who will no doubt get plenty of screen time and no small portion of the action. But it’s also intended to be the starting point for a Marvel-style “cinematic universe” built around Universal’s monster movies, with Russell Crowe as a Nick Fury-like Dr Henry Jekyll investigating the emergence of various strange creatures in the modern day. Quite whether The Invisible Man and Frankenstein’s Monster can team up without recalling awful memories of Abbott and Costello’s silly 1950s capers in the company of various past-their-best beasties remains to be seen., We’ve seen every type of King Arthur tale from whimsical Disney animated musical (The Sword in the Stone) to doom-drenched, mud-caked mediaeval fantasy (Excalibur) on the big screen. Now Guy Ritchie brings us a version in which cheeky cockney tyke Arthur biffs his way through the entire cast of Game of Thrones in a suspiciously mega-populated version of dark ages Britain. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword arrives in May, and looks as if it might be fun., Those longing to see Idris Elba in a genuinely beefy lead role only need wait until July, when the Hackney-born Englishman stars as gunslinger Roland Deschain in Nikolaj Arcel’s adaptation of/sequel to Stephen King’s venerable series of sprawling fantasy novels, The Dark Tower. This one’s been a long time coming, and a $60m budget suggests an element of compromise. But Arcel has a credible back catalogue (2012’s A Royal Affair won two Silver Bears at Berlin), even if he’s not quite got the industry stature of JJ Abrams or Ron Howard, both of whom had been attached to direct., Pixar has two movies out in 2017. Cars 3 looks like exactly the kind of insipid sequel the pioneering studio promised it would never make, but studio chief John Lasseter is a renowned petrolhead and these films generate billions in merchandise profits. By contrast, Lee Unkrich’s Coco probably has the bravest, most daring setup for a kids’ movie since Up. It’s all about the Mexican Day of the Dead ceremony, and will see a 12-year-old boy set off on an adventure that culminates in a remarkable family reunion – no doubt involving gazillions of colourful skeletons and a trip to the fiery depths of Hades. I told you 2017 was going to be dark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.499776\n",
      "Another painfully protracted awards season has come to a close and it’s ended with a last-minute twist. Moonlight, a $1.5m budget drama about the life of a gay black man, was named best picture at the Oscars – beating out frontrunner La La Land and proving that the Academy might not be so irrelevant after all., This time last year, we’ll be honest, no one was even aware of Moonlight. It only gained buzz during the festival season in September but what films that we do know about this year might make a big impression during 2018’s ceremony?, Given his status as one of the industry’s most powerful film-makers, it’s something of a surprise that Christopher Nolan is yet to receive a best director nomination at the Oscars. It’s perhaps less surprising when you look at the genre of films typically rewarded by the Academy. His sci-fi thriller Inception broke through the barrier of earnestness to the best picture category in 2011 and it scored him a second screenplay nod (the first was for Memento) but it looks like he might finally get the ultimate recognition for his next film Dunkirk. It’s an epic second world war drama, a subgenre that remains a perennial Oscar favorite, and it stars previous nominees Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh and winner Mark Rylance., At the age of just 26, Jennifer Lawrence already has one Oscar, three nominations and countless entirely unplanned pratfalls under her belt. After taking a year out of the race with unintentionally creepy romance Passengers, she’ll be back with a mysterious new project. She’s starring in the latest from new offscreen boyfriend Darren Aronofsky, entitled mother!, about a couple who find their quiet life disturbed by uninvited guests. Aronofsky has a solid track record of directing actors to awards recognition (Ellen Burstyn, Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Natalie Portman) so expect the film’s other stars, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Domhnall Gleeson, to also feature., With increased conversation around the importance of female film-makers, it’s been awfully quiet from the one woman to ever score a best director Oscar. After winning for The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow was snubbed for Zero Dark Thirty, a film some perceived as pro-torture, but her untitled new film could see her become the first female directing nominee since, ermmm, herself. The film in question focuses on the 1967 Detroit riot that claimed the lives of 43 people and saw more than 2,000 buildings destroyed and she’s recruited a buzzy cast, including John Boyega, Straight Outta Compton’s Jason Mitchell and The Revenant’s Will Poulter, to tell the tale., Another Academy mainstay (one win, four nominations to date), Matt Damon could have been up for best actor this year but scheduling conflicts meant he had to give up the lead in Manchester by the Sea to best actor winner Casey Affleck. He still nabbed a nod for producing the drama but 2018 could see him return to the acting categories for one of two new projects. First there’s George Clooney’s 50s-set crime mystery Suburbicon which boasts a script co-penned by the Coens and a cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Oscar Isaac and Josh Brolin. Then there’s Downsizing, Alexander Payne’s satirical comedy about a man who wants to be shrunk which could also see nominations for Kristen Wiig, Alec Baldwin and Christoph Waltz., It’s almost been Chadwick Boseman’s time twice before. Within the space of a year he played both Jackie Robinson and James Brown in 42 and Get On Up respectively but despite both scoring decent reviews, neither was strong enough to become an awards contender. He’s hoping third time’s the charm later this year with another role as a vital figure from black history: this time it’s the first African American justice of the supreme court, Thurgood Marshall. It’s from an unlikely director (Reginald Hudlin whose previous credits are all comedic, including House Party and Boomerang) but it’s fascinating subject matter and has a prime awards season release date this October. , While Rooney Mara did have a role in best picture nominee Lion, it was somewhat thankless, and her other awards-friendly titles of the year (The Secret Scripture, Una) made little impact on the festival circuit. But she’s reuniting with Lion director Garth Davis for her next bid for an Oscar, playing Mary Magdalene in a high-profile new biblical drama. If Davis strikes gold again then the film might also bring awards attention to its other stars Joaquin Phoenix and Chiwetel Ejiofor and could lead to a host of other Bible-based pics on the way., This year’s Oscars might have led to success for a diverse set of winners but one usually rewarded group that was shut out? White British women. That’s likely to change next year though with Academy-adored Judi Dench in the running thanks to period drama Victoria and Abdul. Because if there’s one thing the Oscars love it’s Dench playing dead queens (she’s nabbed one nomination and one win for doing this in the past) and she’s playing Queen Victoria again in a Stephen Frears-directed film about her relationship with a young Indian clerk. She also has a solid track record with Frears: her last nomination was thanks to his film Philomena., While the Academy does have a history of aligning itself to traditional, often staid film-makers, it’s also got a soft spot for some more offbeat choices. Paul Thomas Anderson is such a director, boasting six nominations, and he’s reuniting with Daniel Day-Lewis for his latest, a combination that saw There Will Be Blood score two wins back in 2008. Their untitled latest focuses on London’s fashion world in the 1950s and will most likely see Day-Lewis back in the running as well., Seen as one of last year’s major snubs for his powerful role in Beasts of No Nation, Idris Elba might finally score his first nomination for romantic drama The Mountain Between Us. He’s starring alongside Kate Winslet in a film about two people involved in a plane crash who struggle to survive in the wilderness. The Academy loves a) survival tales and b) films starring Kate Winslet so expect Elba and the film to be major contenders., The only film on this list that people have actually seen so far is Sundance breakout Mudbound, which premiered to rapturous reviews in January. It’s about two families, one black and one white, brought together by the second world war and much of the praise was aimed at singer Mary J Blige, whose previous screen credits have included Black Nativity and Rock of Ages. The film might also see Dee Rees become the first black woman to ever receive a nomination for best director.

      "Is the blockbuster in trouble? On the surface, to suggest such a thing might seem as foolish as handing out the wrong envelope at the biggest event of the film calendar because you were busy tweeting pictures of Emma Stone. This is the blockbuster we’re talking about. It’s Luke Skywalker, Jurassic World, Disney, The Avengers, Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Pixar. It’s the Rock punching his fist through a building. It’s the effects-driven cultural juggernaut that powers the entire film industry. Does it look as if it’s in trouble?, A glance at the balance sheet for the year to date would cement the view that the blockbuster is in rude health. Total grosses are higher at this stage than any of the past five years. Logan, the Lego Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island have all pulled in big audiences globally. And then there’s Beauty and the Beast, a true cultural phenomenon, currently racing its way up the all-time rankings. All this and there’s still a new Star Wars instalment, another Spider-Man reboot, Wonder Woman, Justice League, Alien: Covenant, Blade Runner 2049, plus sequels of (*deep breath*) Guardians of the Galaxy, Cars, World War Z, Kingsman, Transformers, Fast and the Furious, Planet of the Apes, Despicable Me, Thor and Pirates of the Caribbean still to come. Hardly the signs of a crisis, it would be fair to say., Dig a little deeper though and the foundations that blockbusters are built on start to look shaky. Last month, Variety published a story that painted a picture of an industry “scared stiff” by its own future, as consumer tastes adapt with changes in technology. Increased pressure from Netflix and Amazon, those digital-disruption barbarians, has caused the big studios to consider changing the way they release movies. The “theatrical window”, the 90-day cushion between a film’s debut in cinemas and its release on DVD or streaming, is set to be reduced to as little as three weeks in an attempt to bolster dwindling home entertainment sales. It’s a move that the industry sees as necessary, as younger viewers develop more adaptable, portable viewing methods, and indeed many smaller productions have begun to release their films on-demand on the same day as in cinemas – it was one of the reasons that Shia LaBeouf’s Man Down grossed a much-mocked £7 in cinemas., At the same time, investors from China – long thought to be Hollywood’s saviour – have suddenly cooled their interest, cancelling major studio deals as the Chinese box office suffers growing pains (with domestic ticket sales only increasing 2.4% in 2016 against a 49% rise the year before) and the government’s crackdown on overseas investment starts to bite. Add to that a couple of high-profile recent flops – Scarlett Johansson’s Ghost in the Shell, Matt Damon’s The Great Wall, the unintentionally creepy Chris Pratt/Jennifer Lawerence sci-fi Passengers, Jake Gyllenhaal’s Alien knock-off Life – and you have an industry that’s not as thriving as the blockbuster bluster might suggest., Hollywood’s response to this instability has been to double down, focusing on blockbusters to the exclusion of just about everything else. In the past decade the summer blockbuster season has mission-crept its way well into spring, a phenomenon that has been termed “cultural global warming” this year, Logan was released a mere three days after the Oscars ended. The resulting effect is of a full calendar year of blockbusters, with a small drop-off for Oscars season in January and February – and even in that period this year we still saw the releases of The Lego Batman Movie, The Great Wall, John Wick 2 and the lamentable Monster Trucks., Meanwhile, the mid-budget film – that hardy perennial that used to help prop up the industry by costing relatively little and often earning lots (think Sophie’s Choice or LA Confidential) has largely been abandoned by the major studios, its potential profit margins seen as insufficiently high when the cost of things such as marketing is factored in. Which isn’t to say that mid-budget films don’t exist, it’s just that they’re being made by smaller, independent studios – see Arrival and Get Out for recent successful examples – or most frequently as TV series. (There’s that Netflix, disrupting things again.), In essence, what this all means for the industry is that it’s blockbuster or bust. Studios have looked at the shifting landscape and decided to react by filling it with superheroes, action stars and CGI creatures, making more blockbusters than they used to, but fewer films in total. The old tentpole formula, where a few big films would shelter the mid-range and low-budget stuff, has largely been abandoned. “The blockbusters are about reducing the films these studios produce down to a minimum,” say Steven Gaydos, vice-president and executive editor at Variety. “They make nothing but big bets. You have to keep building a bigger and better spaceship.”, It’s a high-risk strategy and one that, in the form of Disney and their Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar franchises, has brought big rewards. But this sudden ratcheting up of the stakes means that the cost of failure has become far more pronounced. Last year Viacom was forced to take a $115m (£92m) writedown on Monster Trucks, while Sony took a writedown of nearly $1bn on their entire film division after a faltering couple of years., While those losses might be explained away as the result of bad bets on bad films – Monster Trucks was infamously based on an idea by an executive’s five-year-old son – they hint at the apocalypse that could ensue if a broader, industry-wide problem were to present itself. Namely, what if the public loses its appetite for the blockbuster?, It’s not entirely without precedent: in the late 1950s, as television threatened to steal a march on cinema, studios responded by going big. Spectacle was seen as the key: westerns, musicals and sword-and-sandal epics dominated. But audiences soon grew tired of these hackneyed genres and ticket sales continued to dwindle. That time the industry survived, thanks first to the injection of vitality provided by the edgy, arty New Hollywood films, then later with the early blockbusters such as Jaws and Star Wars., Could such a mass tuning-out happen again? Certainly, there’s an eerie echo in the way that Hollywood has reacted to changing times with size and spectacle, but also in their narrow focus. Once an erotic thriller such as Fatal Attraction or a musical drama such as Footloose might have reasonably been considered a blockbuster. Nowadays the blockbuster almost exclusively resides in the action, fantasy, kids’ film or superhero genres., The superhero film in particular looms large over the industry, as every studio tries to replicate the formula set by Marvel. Ever-more niche caped crusaders are being given their own films – Batgirl, Aquaman, the Gotham City Sirens – in an attempt to unearth a new Deadpool. Spider-Man and Batman have once again been rebooted in an attempt to freshen up the respective franchises. And, of course, everyone wants their own “cinematic universe” – a vast galaxy of characters that together can generate a seemingly infinite number of spin-offs, sequels and prequels. At this very moment, the creators of Call of Duty are actively seeking to turn their grisly shoot-em-ups into a series of interlocking films, while James Cameron – a director whose preferred method of cracking a nut is with a sledgehammer, you suspect – is creating a universe around his smash-hit Avatar, replete with five sequels, graphic novels, actual novels and, most bewilderingly, a Cirque du Soleil show., These shared universes actively court the sort of audiences who will turn up to every film, buy the action figures, don the cosplay outfits and eat the branded breakfast cereal – in other words, teenage boys. “The dominant ideology is fanboy culture,” says Gaydos. “It is adolescent. It is conflict resolution by violence. It is wish-fulfillment, spectacle and diversion – sound and fury, if we want to get Shakespearean.”, Truly, the geeks have inherited the earth. But what about the rest of us? How many people have the time, energy or inclination to sit through, say, all the films in the forthcoming Universal Monsters shared universe, which begins this year with a reboot of The Mummy and has revivals of Wolf Man, Van Helsing and the Invisible Man in pre-production? Greenlighting this series of films without knowing whether anyone is going to bother to watch even the first of them looks like a risky endeavour, and the recent plight of the Divergent YA film franchise, whose latest film is being released as a TV movie due to lack of interest, offers up a cautionary tale that studios should perhaps be paying attention to., But what’s striking about all these blockbusters is how youth-skewed they are, at a time when a third of cinemagoers in the US are over the age of 50. Older audiences can enjoy The Avengers as much as everyone else, of course, but pitching your market primarily towards young people is a risky strategy. Young people tend to be the most fickle audience, one whose attention “is split in a million places”, says Gaydos. They’re also the audience least able to splash out on cinema tickets. And of course they’re an audience who are becoming increasingly accustomed to watching content on their phones, laptops and smart TVs., In other words, they’re the ones likely to force through the seismic change the industry is currently fretting over. If they lose interest in the modern blockbuster in the way that younger audiences turned away from the westerns, musicals and historical epics in the 1960s, the studios will have to find something shiny and new to wave in their faces – and this time they won’t have something akin to the New Hollywood to court them with, as that sort of transgressive, edgy, groundbreaking fare is increasingly turning up on the small screen., Perhaps the best thing the studios can do in the face of this new world is to show some imagination in how they develop and present their blockbusters – and there are signs that this is already happening. Producer Stephen Woolley, who has worked on films such as The Crying Game and the forthcoming adaptation of On Chesil Beach, cites Deadpool as a film that has subtly managed to shift the perception of the superhero movie. “It’s taking a much more sophisticated view of that world and ridiculing it, while at the same reinforcing it. It was a clever have-your-cake-and-eat-it from the people who created it.”, Meanwhile, Disney’s successful live-action reimaginings of their animated works – most notably Beauty and the Beast and The Jungle Book – suggests that it’s possible to play the sequels and remakes game without it feeling like a retread over old ground. Most remarkably of all, the musical seems to be making a comeback with the success of La La Land, that rare mid-budget movie to have crossed over into blockbuster status, grossing more than $400m at a budget of $37m., Woolley is aware of the risks swirling around the blockbuster, but feels that mass extinction is still some way away, if it ever comes. “The danger you have is that audiences are fickle, and they could suddenly turn off,” he says. “Something happens for them to say: ‘Actually, we don’t like those movies any more.’ And there’s always this inkling that it might happen. But every time it seems to happen on the blockbuster front, another movie comes out to prove you wrong.”, Ultimately, though, what might keep the blockbuster safe for the time being is not the films themselves but all the stuff around them. “The thing that the studios are making is something akin to a hypermovie or a supermovie,” says Gaydos. “It’s a whole other thing. It’s a toy-delivery system. A Cars movie will gross $500m or $600m but the Cars products will sell $4bn. Ultimately the movie is designed to be a giant marketing tool for merchandise and theme parks that generate billions and billions.”, As Hollywood agonises over its own future, it might be that the best way for the blockbuster to survive is to subsume itself into bigger, more secure revenue streams: toys, games, merchandise, live attractions. So if you want to keep the blockbuster around for a while longer, you should get your Superman costume on and pour yourself a bowl of that branded cereal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.466810\n",
      "Given the repetitive influx of superhero films in recent years, you’d be forgiven for wanting very little to do with anything involving a cape, a mask and a post-credits teaser for a long time. But wait, the R-rated Wolverine sequel Logan hits cinemas this week and critics agree that it’s worth getting over yourself for., Many are saying it will join the ranks of the all-time greats but what else should be on this list? Here are seven of the best from Guardian writers., Was 2004 the superheroes’ annus mirabilis? That was when Marvel Studios initiated its ambitious plan to self-finance its movies, buy back the rights to characters such as Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and begin the 21st-century wave of superhero films, hugely popular with the public, but often patronised and dismissed the way westerns used to be., But something else happened in 2004: the release of Pixar’s glorious animated superhero homage The Incredibles. That’s a film which doesn’t fit easily into the superhero fanbase-constituency, and is part of neither the Marvel nor DC tribe (unless you count the fact that Pixar, like Marvel, is part of Disney). And I’m conscious that in calling it a “homage” I may even now be denying it full superhero-film status. But a brilliant superhero film is what it is – riffing on the X-Men and Fantastic Four – with superb characters, a great supervillain, a terrific story and a sharp satiric theme on the subject of excellence, and the nature of risk, jeopardy and the state., Mr Incredible (voiced by Craig T Nelson) is a lantern-jawed, barrel-chested superhero who plies his trade in the 1940s, the superheroes’ postwar first-generation comic book heyday. He is fighting alongside his fiancee, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). When a member of the public sues him for preventing his suicide, it triggers a legal nightmare forcing the government to outlaw superheroism and to relocate “supers” to other cities with new identities and bland normality. Twenty years later, he and Elastigirl have suburban lives and he works in insurance – a nightmarish perversion of his former calling. They have two kids whose superpowers they have to conceal at school. But then a new villain emerges with a secret connection to the Incredibles’ past, forcing them to reclaim their vocation – and their destiny., It is rightly celebrated for the superhero costumière, Edna Mode, voiced by the director and writer, Brad Bird, who thinks that capes are a bad idea and is passionately committed to her contemporary vision: “I never look back, darling it distracts from the now.” There is a wonderful passage on the phenomenon of supervillains “monologuing” – huge third-act set-piece speeches in which the villains talk about themselves and their awful vision., Actually, in 2017, the non-talky streamlined all-action superhero film is pretty much against both capes and monologuing and also against Edna Mode’s injunction against looking back. Superhero films love origin myths, elaborate retro sequences from the past and all-around ancestor worship., But as it happens, and incredible as it may sound, The Incredibles has a brilliant action sequence, as exciting as anything in any live-action superhero film or action film. Elastigirl and the two kids are flying in their plane to an island from which the errant Mr Incredible has sent a distress signal. Then she is attacked by rockets. The subsequent “chase” scene and midair explosion are absolutely nail-biting., It is witty, smart, visually ravishing, and its generic insights are celebratory, not derisive. What a great superhero film. PB, I have to be honest: I am not the world’s biggest superhero movie fan. Put another way, when they took off in the late 80s, I thought they were a fad that would blow over in a few years more fool me. In fact, the elevation to ever-prolonging ubiquity is one of the great mysteries of contemporary cinema: how this genre, that for years was considered only good for doltish teens, and treated with equivalent lack of respect, has steadily evolved into the mainstay of the global film industry. Be that as it may, I prefer the funny, candy-coloured type of superhero movie (Spider-Man, Thor, Deadpool) rather than the furrowed-brow earnestathons (Batman Begins, Captain America, Man of Steel) – I’ve never seen a superhero movie weighty or nuanced enough to justify the heavy-duty treatment., But as films – as opposed to moving comic-books – superhero movies tend to fall down pretty hard. There are great sequences, brilliant set pieces, very nice shots – but they rarely hold together, still less allowing actual narrative subtlety to intrude on the scene-shifting. The first – and still, by my reckoning, only – time that a superhero movie seemed way ahead of everything else was the first Tim Burton Batman, from 1989. A tour de force of design, cinematography, and cinematic texture, it was light years ahead of (the nevertheless highly enjoyable) Superman films that had blazed the superhero trail in the 1970s and 80s. Burton’s brilliance was to make everything else look redundant – and in many ways, nothing has changed since. AP, Here’s a conspiracy theory: someone at the Academy purposefully shuffled those envelopes to detract from the much bigger scandal earlier in the evening: the snubbing of Garry Shandling in this year’s Oscars In Memoriam montage. I hope my choice of the Marvel movie in which he cameos as a sinister Hydra disciple will go some way to righting this wrong. , Shandling’s 15-second appearance in this sequel to the first film featuring the weed who becomes the most fantastic hunk is one of my chief reasons for picking it the other is it’s literally the only superhero movie I can ever really remember enjoying., This is obviously a personal deficit, but perhaps it is, actually, a better superhero movie than most? There are terrific action sequences, for a start: that initial heist, fuelled with sexual tension between the Cap and the Black Widow, plus the most wonderful punch-up in a lift. Plus, vegetables to accompany all that meat and beef: a properly thought-provoking investigation of the morals of surveillance and the ethics of vigilantism in a democratically accountable society., But perhaps what really clinched it for me as an Avengers movie I could get along with was the relative dearth of Robert Downey Jr. The more you can minimise this man, the more I shall like any movie. CS, Many are hailing Logan for stretching the boundaries of what a superhero movie can be. It’s dramatic, fervid, and realistic in its violence. But let’s not do away with what’s core to comics culture: deep, dank nerdery that ought not be allowed to see daylight., I love comic books rich in lore and steeped in mythos, swirling in and out of realms with names impossible to spell. Thor: The Dark World stuffs two handfuls of delicious dorkiness into its maw, one rich in fantasy, the other in science fiction. Is the Asgardian bio-bed a quantum field generator or a “Soul Forge”? The answer, of course, is that it is both., Thor: The Dark World has portals and Kronan Rock Men and invisible spaceships and a ray that can curl you up into a singularity and zap you into another dimension. A liquid totem called the Aether is almost in Malekith the Dark Elf’s nefarious grasp, just in time for the quinquennial cosmic event known as the Convergence. Oh, God, I need to stop typing and grab my asthma inhaler, this sort of talk gets me all worked up., In the middle of all this, there’s the bickering romance between the sharp and sweet doctor played by Natalie Portman and her hunky blonde blue-eyed spaceman, Thor. When they reunite during a battle, the first thing she does is yell at him for never calling. When they visit Thor’s realm, Dr Foster quickly bonds with Thor’s mother. They may as well be eating intergalactic coffee cake. And there are still some who say mixed marriages can’t work?!?, Thor: The Dark World is a rush of Absolute Comics mainlined direct to my amygdala, with a profound purity that few other modern superhero movies allow themselves. It is Worthy. JH, While Batman Begins was a refreshingly coherent, mature and dark-hued film about the Caped Crusader (a relief after the eye-punishing gaudy excess of Batman &amp Robin), it was far from a masterpiece. , There was a major villain problem (a somewhat gimmicky last act switcheroo that didn’t quite have the required impact) and a major Katie Holmes problem (needs no explanation) and as a result, it was a promising franchise-restarter but not the home run we might have hoped for. Three years later, Christopher Nolan returned, lessons learned and homework done, with a sequel that rose far above its generic peers and, despite the creation of the hero-packed DC and Marvel universes since, it easily remains unsurpassed. , The Dark Knight moves like a fiendish thriller, one that confidently pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre in a way that comic book fans may be familiar with but which for cinema-goers such as myself was a revelation. It’s a breathtakingly brutal film, packed with staggering PG-13 violence and a bleak worldview that’s unrelenting, grounding fantastical characters and situations in a world that, for once, is depressingly easy to relate to., That villain problem? Easily fixed. The casting of Heath Ledger in the role of the Joker might have been initially unpopular with fans, who couldn’t envision his leading man looks buried under cartoonish makeup, but his performance was dynamite, an Oscar-winning fireball of anger and anarchy. That Katie Holmes problem? Replaced. Maggie Gyllenhaal added depth and a genuine emotional connection which led to the shocking finale carrying even greater weight. It’s one of the rare examples of a superhero film where each devastating act of violence or aggression has a lasting impact. In Nolan’s Gotham City, life and death both mean something., It might be to blame for the dreary drudgery that’s bogged down many ensuing superhero adventures but it remains a ruthlessly entertaining example of just how daring and necessary the genre can be. BL, It may be difficult to credit given Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice recently picked up a gaggle of Razzies, but Zack Snyder was once seen as the coming man of comic book movies. His 2009 adaptation of Alan Moore’s sprawling graphic novel about an alternative 1980s in which Nixon remains in power and superheroes are real remains a high point of the film-maker’s career – and proof that given a decent script, he is capable of producing eye-popping cinema beyond that of most his contemporaries. , The bravura opening montage, set to the strains of Bob Dylan’s The Times They Are A Changin’, is unequalled in comic book movies. The casting is impeccable: Jackie Earl Haley has never been better than as the hardboiled, morally immovable vigilante Rorschach, a gurning, spitting man out of time whose psychological torment is written on his face whether wearing that famous mask or not. Patrick Wilson is wonderfully understated as the taciturn Nite Owl, a superhero who looks like an accountant with middle-aged spread, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as the leering, sneering, cigar-smoking alpha male scumbag the Comedian, a role which surely won him the part of the villain Negan in The Walking Dead. , Naysayers argue that Watchmen is too close to its source material, bar a sensibly altered denouement. But Moore’s story is so epic in scale and splendid in its unexpectedly detailed rendering of the inner psyches of costumed crimefighters that Snyder was really only required to add visual flare. If there is a Citizen Kane of superhero movies, this is indisputably it. BC, The best thing about this time traveling entry into the vast annals of X-Men history is the absolute disregard Bryan Singer had for newcomers. If you hadn’t been paying attention to his line of mutant entertainment over the last decade or so, you’d feel a bit like Kyle Reese being spat out into 1984 with no clothes and no idea what was happening. That slightly manic pace, which feels like it’s borrowed from a daytime soap opera, plus the period costume and references to Vietnam, Nixon and the height of 70s cold war paranoia made this a strangely daring superhero film. , Instead of something that tried to set out the basic idea of what the X-Men were and what they were all about – a concept most grandmothers could probably grasp by now – this just got straight into the internal machinations of a group that makes the EU look harmonious. Of course, the old themes of good and evil doing battle, and overcoming personal demons (in this case addiction for Professor X) are there, but it was delivered in a knowingly strange way. You could even argue the hectic feel and funny but slightly smug lines set the stage for the least superhero-y superhero of them all, Deadpool. Singer knew fans were au fait with the concept of time travel, and would love to see Magneto and Professor X as their younger selves, so he threw it all into a blender and Days of Future Past came out like a perfectly mixed bit of superhero bechamel.

      "It’s clear to anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Oscars that winning an award is as much about campaigning as it is about being, you know, good. So while this year’s nominations might have only just been announced, you can bet that studios are already prepping their potential prize horses for next year’s ceremony., This time last year, execs were hoping the following films would be in the conversation, but instead La La Land, Moonlight and Arrival have dominated. Bow your heads for the never-even-rans., While the Academy did find time to bring Mel Gibson back into the fold with a best director nod for the gruesome second world war epic Hacksaw Ridge, another comeback was well and truly denied. It’s not exactly a snub, though: Warren Beatty’s long-gestating Howard Hughes comedy was a bit of a washout, picking up a range of mostly uninterested reviews. Back to the drawing board for another 18 years, then., In contrast with the other films on this list, there’s actually plenty to enjoy in this bitter tale of business and burgers. There’s refreshingly unsentimental career-best work from The Blind Side director John Lee Hancock, a ferocious lead turn from Michael Keaton and an unsparingly bleak look at how McDonald’s actually came to be. But awards have been absent despite the pedigree, and the Weinsteins pushing it, making it a shoulda-been rather than a coulda-been. It’s likely that a film about a hard-edged, amoral businessman mistreating others to craft a business empire isn’t the film people want to see right now ..., Matthew McConaughey has been gradually making a worrying U-turn back towards mediocrity after a laughed-out-of-Cannes turn in Gus Van Sant’s The Sea of Trees led to two failed Oscar-bait projects: the slavery drama Free State of Jones and this underwhelming caper. From Stephen Gaghan, whose two Oscar-touched screenplays for Traffic and Syriana were, well, quite a while ago, this aborted attempt to turn a hunt for gold into a Wolf of Wall Street-esque comedy had once attracted Michael Mann and Spike Lee. Both are probably glad they steered clear, with middling reviews helping to further sink the McConaissance., Last year saw two fact-based films about interracial romance – the subdued yet powerful Loving and this less subdued but still rather stirring drama. Starring Rosamund Pike in her first major lead role since she scored an Oscar nomination for Gone Girl, and David Oyelowo, cruelly snubbed for Selma, it seemed like a done deal. But while reviews were mostly positive, they weren’t ecstatic, most agreeing that while effective, it was all a tad old-fashioned and the film has an awards unfriendly release date in the US next month. Loving didn’t fare much better, scoring just one well-deserved nod for its star Ruth Negga., Ang Lee isn’t a director with a spotless record. If you were one of the few people who accidentally watched Taking Woodstock on cable late one night, then this you know to be true. But after Lee’s second Oscar, this time for Life of Pi, one would expect a great deal more than this awkward misfire, adapted from an award-winning book by Ben Fountain and given a prime slot in the New York film festival. Indeed, no one could have expected just quite how unsuccessful this war on terror drama would be. Hampered by pointless visual tinkering (it boasted a super-high frame rate) and bored reviews, it couldn’t even crack the $2m mark in the US despite a $40m budget. Keep walking, Billy, and don’t you stop., Due to the timing and the scale of the films being screened, Sundance isn’t seen as a typical launchpad for Oscar contenders. But after last year’s festival, it was seen as settled that Nate Parker’s slavery epic would be a major force at the 2017 Oscars. Reviews were mostly ecstatic as the festival coincided with another all-white set of Oscar nominees and Fox forked out a record $17.5m for the rights. But two things happened in the ensuing months: Parker’s college rape accusation came to light and, well outside of the festival frenzy, critics realized that it wasn’t even that good anyway. Parker’s epic fall from grace ended this week with zero Oscar nominations for his flawed film., Remember when you couldn’t leave your house without a stranger forcing you at gunpoint to watch three Jessica Chastain films in a row while agreeing that each was deserving of Oscar buzz? Those days are, thankfully, over – and so it seems is the actor’s ability to garner quite as much attention. Seemingly out of nowhere she emerged with an Oscar nomination for The Help, a role in the Oscar-nominated The Tree of Life and an Oscar nomination for Zero Dark Thirty. Oscar! She also cropped up in the Oscar-nominated The Martian more recently. But a lead role in this horrendously misjudged gun lobby drama is an embarrassing awards plea that removes Chastain from the Oscar conversation entirely. , When Batman v Superman turned out to be even less coherent and even more odious than anyone thought possible, Ben Affleck fans consoled themselves with the knowledge that at least he would end 2016 back in everyone’s good books. His Prohibition-era thriller boasted a strong cast (Affleck himself, Zoe Saldana, Elle Fanning, Chris Cooper, Brendan Gleeson, ermmm ... Miguel) and even stronger source material (his prior Dennis Lehane adaptation was the excellent Gone Baby Gone) but he somehow managed to mess it all up with an alternately undercooked and overcooked mess. It became his worst-reviewed film as director by around 60 percentage points on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "Awards season gathers steam on Sunday as Hollywood’s second most significant set of film prizes is handed out. The 74th Golden Globes promise a new emphasis on youth and diversity, in stark contrast to recent years, which have seen all major movie awards bodies dogged by accusations of prejudice and bias., Yet, as far as the gongs themselves go, the Globes also seem certain to offer a night of no surprises – and certainly no indication of how the Oscars will shake down. Traditionally perceived as a barometer of Academy Awards glory, this year’s edition – because the Globes split their categories into drama and musical/comedy – looks likely to reward both Oscars frontrunners: coming-of-age tale Moonlight and tune-packed romance La La Land., Moonlight, already the winner of more than 120 awards, has won much praise for its backstory as well as narrative: a black director and an all-black cast telling the life of a gay man in an impoverished Miami community. House of Cards star Mahershala Ali is favourite to win the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his role as a fatherly drug dealer although co-star Naomie Harris, best known for her role as Moneypenny in the Bond franchise, is likely to miss out on best supporting actress to Viola Davis for Fences, an adaptation of the August Wilson play directed by its star, Denzel Washington. Those victories would mean two wins for actors of colour the first time in five years a black star has won a Globe., The Oscar nominations on 24 January look set to follow suit in terms of their ethnic spread, in part the result of a clutch of films – also including Hidden Figures and The Birth of a Nation – offering actors of colour showcase roles, and in part a reaction to the #OscarsSoWhite backlash. The Academy has made concerted efforts over the past 12 months to broaden its pool of about 7,000 voters, with around half of a new intake of members last summer being either non-white or female. Similar efforts, however, do not seem to have been made at the Globes, which are voted for by 90-odd members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. , Success for La La Land would be a less immediately radical departure: a hymn to Hollywood in the mould of previous Oscar winners Argo and The Artist, which stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as toe-tapping, star-crossed wannabes in contemporary Los Angeles. Yet the youth of its director, Damien Chazelle, who at 31 is already on his third feature, as well as that of Moonlight’s 37-year-old director Barry Jenkins, is seen as a healthy indicator of movie industry renewal. , Meanwhile, veterans such as Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood have found themselves snubbed as both their new movies, Silence and Sully, failed to score a single nomination. The sole representative of old Hollywood comes in the unlikely form of Mel Gibson, whose grisly war drama Hacksaw Ridge is up for best director and best drama, as well as best actor for Andrew Garfield., Kenneth Lonergan’s sombre Manchester By the Sea, which stars Casey Affleck as a janitor who becomes the guardian of his dead brother’s child, is also likely to do well. Affleck looks a strong bet for best actor (drama), while Lonergan could well carry off best director or screenwriter, or both., With a ceremony traditionally more raucous and informal than the Oscars, the Globes have announced an eclectic list of stars as presenters, while law-enforcement agencies are promising a “tremendous” amount of security around the event., This year’s host Jimmy Fallon has already said he will include multiple jokes aimed at reality star turned president-elect Donald Trump, but also suggested they won’t be unduly mean-spirited. “If I hit somebody, it’s a very subtle hit, and everyone’s in on the joke,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “I want to make sure everyone’s laughing and having a good time. And I’m hopefully going to book the people in this crowd the next week, so I’ll be edgy, but it’s all in good fun, and I know how far I can take it.”, The ex-Saturday Night Live comic and current late-night host had attracted fire for inviting Trump on his show before the election and failing to quiz him on any of his more offensive remarks. , The Golden Globes awards ceremony will take place on 8 January, in Beverly Hills, California.

      "Even with months to go before next year’s Academy Awards, and loads of vying films still to be unveiled, one thing about the race is certain: the pool of female actors is stacked. While Tom Hanks and Casey Affleck were arguably the only male actors to receive major awards momentum from the recent slate of fall film festivals (for their performances in Sully and Manchester by the Sea, respectively), a glut of their female colleagues have emerged as surefire contenders., La La Land’s Emma Stone and Jackie’s Natalie Portman lead the charge for their career-best work in the two ecstatically received films. The pair are closely followed by Amy Adams, who earned major plaudits for Denis Villeneuve’s brainy sci-fi Arrival, and Annette Bening for her work in 20th Century Women., On the supporting end of the spectrum, Viola Davis has become the hot favorite after reviews hit for Fences, a drama that sees her reprise her Tony award-winning role opposite Denzel Washington. She faces stiff competition from perennial Academy favorite Michelle Williams, who’s out to break hearts as Affleck’s grieving ex-wife in Manchester by the Sea., All the aforementioned women are sure to have busy few months ahead, as is Meryl Streep, whose latest bid for gold, Florence Foster Jenkins, opened this summer., With such a bounty of exceptional female performances, many are bound to fall by the wayside. We’re here to course correct that. After all, what’s a proper awards season without a few curveballs?, Rebecca Hall has been working steadily for 20 years, impressing audiences in The Town, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and The Prestige. Still, it took until now for her to land a role as complex and demanding as the one she undertakes in Christine, Antonio Campos’s dark character study about Christine Chubbuck, the news anchor who achieved notoriety in the 70s for killing herself on live TV. Hall is astonishing in the role, fearlessly digging into Chubbuck’s deep-set insecurities to yield a deeply empathetic portrait of a woman on the verge., Fernanda Montenegro was the last Brazilian actor to be nominated for a best actress Oscar for 1998’s Central Station. Sônia Braga deserves to be the second. She’s commanding in Kleber Mendonça Filho’s riveting character study as Clara, a widowed and retired music critic being driven out of her home. Braga, best known to English-speaking audiences for her Golden Globe-nominated turn in Kiss of the Spider Woman, has worked steadily since, but it took over three decades for Mendonça to give her a role fiery enough to showcase her formidable power., Sally Hawkins delivers a performance to rival her Golden Globe-winning breakthrough in Mike Leigh’s Happy-Go-Lucky in Maudie, a biopic of the Canadian folk artist Maudie Dowley Lewis. Aisling Walsh’s small period drama premiered at the Telluride film festival to a modicum of buzz and failed to generate much more in Toronto, but Hawkins is too good to ignore. She expertly conveys the effects Lewis’s juvenile rheumatoid arthritis took on her body, without letting the affliction take over her portrait. It’s thoroughly grounded and heartfelt work., Whatever your take on Paul Feig’s much-contested reboot of Ghostbusters, there’s no denying it got one thing right: it let Kate McKinnon fly her freak flag as the group’s wacky engineer. Of the formidable ensemble, the Saturday Night Live favorite proves the most compulsively watchable, marshaling a bevy of endearing quirks into a star-making, supremely confident turn. Her scene-stealing allure mirrors the effect Melissa McCarthy had in Feig’s 2011 comedy Bridesmaids, which resulted in an Oscar nomination for the comedian. McKinnon deserves to follow in her footsteps., It’s easy to take Allison Janney for granted – she’s superlative in everything she appears in … and Janney works a lot. The prolific actor has long been recognized on the small screen, dating back to her four-Emmy tally for The West Wing – but strangely, the film world has yet to catch up in rewarding her with any type of major recognition. Janney is stellar in Tallulah, an overlooked indie offering that premiered at Sundance, only to land on Netflix with a bit of a thud. No matter. As an academic mother forced to befriend a stranger who claims to be her estranged son’s pregnant girlfriend (played by Ellen Page), Janney once again proves to be among today’s most beguiling talents., Ira Sachs’s Little Men is anchored by a number of remarkable performances, but none feel as authentic as Paulina Garcia’s portrayal of Leonor, a single mother, fighting to keep her quaint clothing store afloat and her boy fed. In her first English-language project, Garcia (so strong in the 2013 arthouse hit Gloria) isn’t afraid to explore her character’s unsympathetic tendencies, resulting in a work that’s deeply humane and hard to shake., Miracles From Heaven, a faith-based family drama about a family grappling with the seemingly impossible, is not a good film. It’s crass Christian propaganda that preaches to the choir – and no one else. Jennifer Garner, who leads the drama as a churchgoing southern belle whose daughter is diagnosed with a potentially fatal disorder, however, is excellent. Throwing herself into the project as if it’s an awards pony, and not the Lifetime film it in fact is, Garner gives the role her all, imbuing her mama lion with a fierce resiliency that slowly crumbles as her daughter’s health worsens. She’s tremendously effective the picture surrounding her is nothing but manipulative., In Equity, Anna Gunn embodies a ruthless senior investment banker who bears no resemblance to Skyler White, the long-suffering matriarch she played to perfection on five seasons of Breaking Bad. She manages the difficult feat of owning her character’s Wall Street lingo while bringing real urgency to the part of a woman facing an uphill battle in her profession solely because of her sex. She’s a powerhouse., Kate Beckinsale rids herself of her Underworld pleather catsuits to don a corset for Love and Friendship, and emerges with the most wry and surprising performance of her career. She’s a hoot to watch as Lady Susan Vernon, a widow with the cunning ability to get what she wants using her wit, smarts and looks. Beckinsale takes such evident joy in playing someone so duplicitous – her energy is infectious., Saturday Night Live veteran Molly Shannon is a proven comedic dynamo – so to watch her nail the nuances of a mother suffering from terminal cancer in Other People comes as a sort of revelation. In Chris Kelly’s semi-autobiographical dark comedy about a struggling gay writer who moves back in with his family to help his sick mother, Shannon is quietly devastating, while retaining her signature humor. It’s a tricky balancing act that only someone of Shannon’s caliber could pull off., Blake Lively channels her inner Ripley in The Shallows to deliver the most arresting performance of her career. The actor has always been an appealing presence, even managing to emerge from Green Lantern relatively unscathed, but in The Shallows she shows a formidable mettle few probably knew she had. Playing a young surfer forced to battle a great white shark, Lively is a mix of brawn and brain. Most impressively, she keeps The Shallows from devolving into B-movie fluff by making her character’s peril feel all too real.

      "The stars of Hidden Figures and Stranger Things were the big winners at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards while political speeches dominated the evening., The cast of the drama based on a true story about three women who played an integral role at Nasa won the big prize of the night for best ensemble in a motion picture. Accepting the award, star Taraji P Henson said: “This story is of unity and this story is about what happens when we put our differences aside ... Love wins.” , One of the film’s stars, Mahershala Ali, won the award for best supporting actor for his role in Moonlight, while Claire Foy and John Lithgow both won dramatic television awards for roles in the Netflix hit The Crown and the cast of Stranger Things won for best ensemble in a drama series., David Harbour, who plays Jim Hopper in the 80s-set adventure, gave a rousing speech on the importance of inclusion. “We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home,” he said. “We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy what we have envisioned for ourselves and the marginalized.” , A visibly upset Ali, who remains the firm favorite to win an Oscar next month, delivered an emotional and topical speech about acceptance. “What I’ve learned from working on Moonlight is seeing what happens when you persecute people,” he said. He talked about converting to Islam yet maintaining a close relationship with his mother, an ordained minister, and begged people to also put aside their religious differences., Emma Stone won the award for best female actor in a lead role for La La Land and after discussing her insecurity in her profession, she spoke about the importance of bringing joy to people given that “we’re in a really tricky time at the moment in our country”.

She also made a passionate reference to Donald Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration. “This immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American,” she said before reading out an official statement on the matter from the Writers Guild of America., The 37-strong cast of Orange Is the New Black won the prize for ensemble in a comedy series for the third time. Taylor Schilling led a speech that reminded the audience that they represented “generations of people who have sought a better life here”., Sarah Paulson picked up the award for best female actor in a television movie or limited series for The People vs OJ Simpson and gave a plea for people to donate to the ACLU “to protect the rights and liberties of people across this country”. Backstage she added: “Silence is not golden at this time.”, Bryan Cranston, winning for his role as Lyndon B Johnson in the television movie All the Way, also spoke about Trump’s presidency. “I’m often asked how would LBJ think about Donald Trump,” he said. “I honestly feel that 36 would put his arm around 45 and earnestly wish him success and also whisper in his ear something ... ‘Just don’t piss in the soup that all of us gotta eat.’”, John Lithgow’s role as Winston Churchill in breakout Netflix drama The Crown won him the award for best actor in a drama series and after thanking those involved in the show, he also thanked Meryl Streep. He said her Golden Globes speech, where she criticized Trump’s bullying tactics, represented his “exact thoughts”., The awards act as a strong indicator of success at the Academy awards, taking place on 26 February.

      "No recent historical cataclysm has eclipsed the magnitude of the second world war. And thank God for that: the war was horrible! Its aftershocks are still felt in many current conflicts. The war touched every life differently, so it’s no wonder authors and film-makers keep returning to it, finding new stories to tell., The Zookeeper’s Wife (out in the US on 31 March), based on the bravery of righteous Polish Gentiles who put their lives on the line to smuggle Jews out of the Warsaw ghetto, is a remarkable true story. But for a number of reasons it isn’t quite the masterpiece it wants to be. It feels improper to shrug off so important a tale, but the truth is that the movie “is OK”., Of course, not everything can be a critical and commercial success like The Best Years of Our Lives, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Hope and Glory, The Thin Red Line, The Pianist or Son of Saul. But rather than dwell on something that is almost good, here, in chronological order, are 10 outstanding, lesser-known second world war movies that, like The Zookeeper’s Wife, illuminate a corner of the war that perhaps doesn’t get as much attention., I know, I know: I left out so many good ones., OK, technically the bulk of this movie is set directly after war is over. A close-knit group of Japanese soldiers fighting in Burma surrender to the British when armistice is declared. When a platoon of Japanese holdouts atop a mountain continue fighting, Pte Mizushima, something of a mascot, volunteers to convince them to put down their weapons. Things don’t go as planned and Mizushima, who has picked up the ability to play a local harp, emerges from the incident transformed., What follows is a long walk through grief toward healing, as Mizushima and his comrades eye each other from opposite sides of a prison fence. While hardly a traditional musical, The Burmese Harp has some of the most heartbreaking scenes of group singing in all of world cinema., Quite lauded at its time, this gem from the Soviet Union is a bit overshadowed these days by the steamier 1957 home front film The Cranes Are Flying. But this is the one that actually put a face to Mother Russia, America and Britain’s great ally until approximately 10 minutes after the war ended., After knocking out two German tanks, a 19-year-old private is offered a commendation. He asks, instead, for a brief furlough to visit his mother and help repair a leaky roof. Along the way, a number of small tasks occupy him, including falling in love. In gorgeous, silvery black-and-white, it’s a rather lovely picture of bravery, and not much different from the propagandized images coming out of Hollywood., It’s impossible not to love this extremely fictionalized but not-exactly-untrue story of how Burt Lancaster beat Nazis to a pulp to make sure French museums could never be beat. John Frankenheimer somehow turned art preservation into a white-knuckle actioner, as train saboteurs conspire to prevent Germany from looting artifacts as they bug out of Paris. On the one hand, it’s silly to get worked up about decorative things when there are lives at stake, but on the other, if not the culture, what are we fighting for? Paul Scofield is particularly slimy as the art-loving villain screaming “schnell!”, A less pugilistic example of French culture in the face of fascism, François Truffaut’s wartime resistance drama also doubles as one of the great “backstage” films. A German-Jewish theater impresario is hiding beneath his own stage, as his wife (Catherine Deneuve) tries to keep the lights on. Recognizable moments of everyday life (or, at least, everyday showbiz life) collide with the grander tragedy of the war. A remarkable ensemble cast (including Gérard Depardieu) allows for an exquisite tapestry of tragedy., Framed as a bedtime story from contemporary suburbia, The Night of the Shooting Stars seesaws between brutal realism and whimsical fairytale. I know that sounds really annoying, but back in 1982 this sort of thing was much more novel in cinema, and the Taviani brothers knew they were breaking ground., A small Italian town cracks apart as it tries to survive the death throes of the war. The retreating Germans are (probably, maybe, we can’t be sure) going to destroy everything in their path, so most of the residents flee, without exactly knowing where to go. Mind games and tragedies await, as well as lighter moments of humanism and humor., One of the few films to focus on Nazi persecution of homosexuals, Bent began as a play and, as such, has many theatrical flourishes beyond Mick Jagger in drag singing about boys in Berlin. At its root, Bent shows how love can find a way, even in the worst of all possible settings. Clive Owen, in one of his earliest major roles, works alongside Lothaire Bluteau in a concentration camp, and the two form a bond despite being unable to touch., Bent is a heavily stylized film (a low-budget indie with that late-90s Channel Four sheen) but the writing is sharp, as are the performances. Blink and you’ll miss them, but in the mix you’ll find the future stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Jude Law, Paul Bettany and Rachel Weisz. Sir Ian McKellen has a tragic scene describing how one must survive under Nazism as (as he puts it) a “fluff”., Let’s face it, all of these movies are depressing, but The Grey Zone is one of the more brutal examples of an “I’d like two Excedrin now!” film., Before Son of Saul, no movie had really “gone inside” Auschwitz with any degree of verisimilitude except Tim Blake Nelson’s The Grey Zone. It focuses on the Jewish Sonderkommando, who kept the gears of death oiled under the promise of another day’s survival and a bit of food. After the initial shock of the setting, the film settles on a seldom-told story of concentration camp insurrection. , We all wonder what we would do if we were put in this horrifying situation. This is the rare film that dares to answer., A film so gruesome one can only interpret it as allegory, Caterpillar focuses on the Japanese home front, and a woman caring for her returning war hero husband. Despite his medals, his acts on the battlefield included rape and barbarism, and he comes back mangled and limbless and covered in burn scars. A putrid husk of extremism and nationalism, he subjects his wife to sexual sadism, while she performs what she considers her wifely and patriotic duty., This is not some weird fetish film. Kôji Wakamatsu’s previous work, United Red Army, is one of the most insightful films about the mania of extreme political groups, and Caterpillar, despite being about the far right instead of the far left, can almost be seen as a companion piece to that great work., A sumptuous fable from the Australian director Cate Shortland, Lore follows a group of children “on their way to Grandmother’s house” after their Nazi parents are taken in by the Americans. The trek is through a weird ellipsis of history survivors emerge from a daze, a nation tries to piece together an identity out of rubble. This is a coming-of-age film, a road film, an adventure film, a dizzying naturalist film and above all a humanist film. At its center is a remarkable performance from Saskia Rosendahl, who begins the story as a precocious girl and ends a wise young woman., A number of films have humanized the German rank-and-file during the second world war. A conversation about Das Boot in the early 1980s caused a Passover seder rift I’ll never forget. Generation War is one that might still push some viewers’ buttons. This, naturally, makes it all the more relevant., At four and a half hours (made for European television, but released theatrically in the United States), the film affords us plenty of time to meet a wide group of friends and follow their wartime experiences. Among them are a decorated soldier and a persecuted Jew, a wide-eyed nurse and an ambitious performer. “Just following orders” is the standard old line, but what’s most striking about this story is seeing how so many can disagree with their government, yet find themselves still going along. Maybe it’s revisionist history, or maybe it’s a warning for the future.

      "It’s sadly not uncommon for a female actor to go from lead to mom to obscurity within the space of a few years, but the rise and fall of the Terms of Endearment star was so notable that it led to a 2002 documentary called Searching for Debra Winger. As she entered a self-imposed retirement, the multiple-Oscar nominee’s last lead was in 1995’s Forget Paris. She returned in the following decade, but with only roles in Rachel Getting Married, and more recently, Ashton Kutcher’s Netflix show, The Ranch, to her name. This summer, however, offers her something rather more substantial: she plays alongside Tracy Letts in The Lovers as a recently separated married couple who have an affair with each other. The trailer suggests major breakout potential., The last time you heard from Val Kilmer? Probably when Michael Douglas claimed he was close to death, something Kilmer then had to embarrassingly deny. The Batman Forever and Tombstone star saw his star appeal diminish in the late 90s with rumors of a difficult reputation (The Island of Dr Moreau marked a particular low point professionally and personally) relegating him to a plentiful array of low-grade action thrillers. But seemingly out of nowhere, he’s set to have a strong year, starring with Michael Fassbender in the Jo Nesbo thriller The Snowman and cropping up alongside Ryan Gosling and Natalie Portman in Terrence Malick’s latest drama, Song to Song. Kilmer Forever!, After roles in Scarface, The Witches of Eastwick and Dangerous Minds, Pfeiffer became one of the most marketable female actors in the industry – but after she took time out for children, Hollywood didn’t make it all that easy for her to return. She appeared in Hairspray and Stardust, but since 2007, her roles have been both minimal and forgettable. She’s got an impressive year ahead though, headlining the indie Where Is Kyra?, which will premier at Sundance later this month appearing in the star-studded remake of Murder on the Orient Express and, most excitingly, starring alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem in Darren Aronofsky’s mysterious drama Mother., Breaking out at a young age in The Karate Kid and Adventures in Babysitting, Shue’s ascent to the A-list in the 90s led to her Oscar-nominated role in Leaving Las Vegas but by the following decade she was relegated to thankless roles in dross like De Niro thriller Hide &amp Seek and playing herself in Hamlet 2. She’s since cut her losses and taken a role in CSI but with the show now (thankfully) over, she’s back competing for roles. Luckily this year has at least one potential doozy: starring with Emma Stone and Steve Carell in Battle of the Sexes, the story behind the iconic tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She’ll also be headed to the multiplex with Bruce Willis as his ill-fated wife in a remake of Death Wish., In 2002, Adam Sandler took a brief break from punishing families across the world to star in Paul Thomas Anderson’s offbeat romance Punch-Drunk Love. It was a tantalizing look at what hidden skills the comic actor possesses and sadly, they have been buried ever since. He’s tried to expand but picked poorly, with The Cobbler and Men, Women and Children both tanking. While his Netflix deal continues to provide him with various opportunities to make jokes about farts and bare breasts, he’s also keen to position himself back in more highbrow company – and 2017 provides him with a stellar opportunity. He’s taking the lead in Noah Baumbach’s comedy Yeh Din Ka Kissa, with a cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Ben Stiller, whose work in Greenberg and While We’re Young remains proof of what Baumbach can do with a comic actor., It’s been 15 years since we last saw Goldie Hawn on the big screen, starring with Susan Sarandon in The Banger Sisters, and a year after Sarandon nabbed her first lead role in many years (in the underrated comedy The Meddler), it seems fitting that she’s also making a comeback. Hawn’s comic talents, on display in Private Benjamin, The First Wives Club and Death Becomes Her, will be put to good use playing the mother of Amy Schumer’s character in the action comedy Snatched. The trailer suggests that she hasn’t lost her touch and the pair will make for a perfect sparring partners., Despite boasting an Oscar, Halle Berry has failed to nab herself an agent able to bring her the scripts she deserves. An almost impossibly long line of disasters (Catwoman, Perfect Stranger, New Year’s Eve, Movie 43) has led to many forgetting her considerable talents. She headed to the small screen with the Spielberg-produced Extant but achieved only moderate success. This year she’s back in force with a role in the action sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, leading the frenetic thriller Kidnap and, most promisingly, starring with Daniel Craig in Mustang director Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s English language debut Kings, about the LA riots of 1992.

      "The stars of Hidden Figures and Stranger Things were the big winners at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards while political speeches dominated the evening., The cast of the drama based on a true story about three women who played an integral role at Nasa won the big prize of the night for best ensemble in a motion picture. Accepting the award, star Taraji P Henson said: “This story is of unity and this story is about what happens when we put our differences aside ... Love wins.” , One of the film’s stars, Mahershala Ali, won the award for best supporting actor for his role in Moonlight, while Claire Foy and John Lithgow both won dramatic television awards for roles in the Netflix hit The Crown and the cast of Stranger Things won for best ensemble in a drama series., David Harbour, who plays Jim Hopper in the 80s-set adventure, gave a rousing speech on the importance of inclusion. “We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home,” he said. “We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy what we have envisioned for ourselves and the marginalized.” , A visibly upset Ali, who remains the firm favorite to win an Oscar next month, delivered an emotional and topical speech about acceptance. “What I’ve learned from working on Moonlight is seeing what happens when you persecute people,” he said. He talked about converting to Islam yet maintaining a close relationship with his mother, an ordained minister, and begged people to also put aside their religious differences., Emma Stone won the award for best female actor in a lead role for La La Land and after discussing her insecurity in her profession, she spoke about the importance of bringing joy to people given that “we’re in a really tricky time at the moment in our country”. Denzel Washington received the award for best male actor in a leading role for his role in Fences after many predicted Manchester by the Sea star Casey Affleck would win. Washington’s co-star, Viola Davis, was the night’s other big screen winner, named best female actor in a supporting role and she dedicated her award to playwright August Wilson for honoring the average man., Julia Louis-Dreyfus won the award for best female actor in a comedy series for Veep and made jabs at the vote being hacked by the Russians as well as the crowd size at the event itself. She also made a passionate reference to Donald Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration. “This immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American,” she said before reading out an official statement on the matter from the Writers Guild of America., The 37-strong cast of Orange Is the New Black won the prize for ensemble in a comedy series for the third time. Taylor Schilling led a speech that reminded the audience that they represented “generations of people who have sought a better life here”., Sarah Paulson picked up the award for best female actor in a television movie or limited series for The People vs OJ Simpson and gave a plea for people to donate to the ACLU “to protect the rights and liberties of people across this country”. Backstage she added: “Silence is not golden at this time.”, Bryan Cranston, winning for his role as Lyndon B Johnson in the television movie All the Way, also spoke about Trump’s presidency. “I’m often asked how would LBJ think about Donald Trump,” he said. “I honestly feel that 36 would put his arm around 45 and earnestly wish him success and also whisper in his ear something ... ‘Just don’t piss in the soup that all of us gotta eat.’”, John Lithgow’s role as Winston Churchill in breakout Netflix drama The Crown won him the award for best actor in a drama series and after thanking those involved in the show, he also thanked Meryl Streep. He said her Golden Globes speech, where she criticized Trump’s bullying tactics, represented his “exact thoughts”., The awards act as a strong indicator of success at the Academy awards, taking place on 26 February. Earlier this week, La La Land scored 14 nominations while Arrival and Moonlight followed with eight each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.518957\n",
      "Awards season gathers steam on Sunday as Hollywood’s second most significant set of film prizes is handed out. The 74th Golden Globes promise a new emphasis on youth and diversity, in stark contrast to recent years, which have seen all major movie awards bodies dogged by accusations of prejudice and bias., Yet, as far as the gongs themselves go, the Globes also seem certain to offer a night of no surprises – and certainly no indication of how the Oscars will shake down. Traditionally perceived as a barometer of Academy Awards glory, this year’s edition – because the Globes split their categories into drama and musical/comedy – looks likely to reward both Oscars frontrunners: coming-of-age tale Moonlight and tune-packed romance La La Land., Moonlight, already the winner of more than 120 awards, has won much praise for its backstory as well as narrative: a black director and an all-black cast telling the life of a gay man in an impoverished Miami community. House of Cards star Mahershala Ali is favourite to win the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his role as a fatherly drug dealer although co-star Naomie Harris, best known for her role as Moneypenny in the Bond franchise, is likely to miss out on best supporting actress to Viola Davis for Fences, an adaptation of the August Wilson play directed by its star, Denzel Washington. Those victories would mean two wins for actors of colour the first time in five years a black star has won a Globe., The Oscar nominations on 24 January look set to follow suit in terms of their ethnic spread, in part the result of a clutch of films – also including Hidden Figures and The Birth of a Nation – offering actors of colour showcase roles, and in part a reaction to the #OscarsSoWhite backlash. The Academy has made concerted efforts over the past 12 months to broaden its pool of about 7,000 voters, with around half of a new intake of members last summer being either non-white or female. Similar efforts, however, do not seem to have been made at the Globes, which are voted for by 90-odd members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. , Success for La La Land would be a less immediately radical departure: a hymn to Hollywood in the mould of previous Oscar winners Argo and The Artist, which stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as toe-tapping, star-crossed wannabes in contemporary Los Angeles. Yet the youth of its director, Damien Chazelle, who at 31 is already on his third feature, as well as that of Moonlight’s 37-year-old director Barry Jenkins, is seen as a healthy indicator of movie industry renewal. , Meanwhile, veterans such as Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood have found themselves snubbed as both their new movies, Silence and Sully, failed to score a single nomination. The sole representative of old Hollywood comes in the unlikely form of Mel Gibson, whose grisly war drama Hacksaw Ridge is up for best director and best drama, as well as best actor for Andrew Garfield., Kenneth Lonergan’s sombre Manchester By the Sea, which stars Casey Affleck as a janitor who becomes the guardian of his dead brother’s child, is also likely to do well. Affleck looks a strong bet for best actor (drama), while Lonergan could well carry off best director or screenwriter, or both., With a ceremony traditionally more raucous and informal than the Oscars, the Globes have announced an eclectic list of stars as presenters, while law-enforcement agencies are promising a “tremendous” amount of security around the event., This year’s host Jimmy Fallon has already said he will include multiple jokes aimed at reality star turned president-elect Donald Trump, but also suggested they won’t be unduly mean-spirited. “If I hit somebody, it’s a very subtle hit, and everyone’s in on the joke,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “I want to make sure everyone’s laughing and having a good time. And I’m hopefully going to book the people in this crowd the next week, so I’ll be edgy, but it’s all in good fun, and I know how far I can take it.”, The ex-Saturday Night Live comic and current late-night host had attracted fire for inviting Trump on his show before the election and failing to quiz him on any of his more offensive remarks. , The Golden Globes awards ceremony will take place on 8 January, in Beverly Hills, California.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.447774\n",
      "Another painfully protracted awards season has come to a close and it’s ended with a last-minute twist. Moonlight, a $1.5m budget drama about the life of a gay black man, was named best picture at the Oscars – beating out frontrunner La La Land and proving that the Academy might not be so irrelevant after all., This time last year, we’ll be honest, no one was even aware of Moonlight. It only gained buzz during the festival season in September but what films that we do know about this year might make a big impression during 2018’s ceremony?, Given his status as one of the industry’s most powerful film-makers, it’s something of a surprise that Christopher Nolan is yet to receive a best director nomination at the Oscars. It’s perhaps less surprising when you look at the genre of films typically rewarded by the Academy. His sci-fi thriller Inception broke through the barrier of earnestness to the best picture category in 2011 and it scored him a second screenplay nod (the first was for Memento) but it looks like he might finally get the ultimate recognition for his next film Dunkirk. It’s an epic second world war drama, a subgenre that remains a perennial Oscar favorite, and it stars previous nominees Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh and winner Mark Rylance., At the age of just 26, Jennifer Lawrence already has one Oscar, three nominations and countless entirely unplanned pratfalls under her belt. After taking a year out of the race with unintentionally creepy romance Passengers, she’ll be back with a mysterious new project. She’s starring in the latest from new offscreen boyfriend Darren Aronofsky, entitled mother!, about a couple who find their quiet life disturbed by uninvited guests. Aronofsky has a solid track record of directing actors to awards recognition (Ellen Burstyn, Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Natalie Portman) so expect the film’s other stars, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Domhnall Gleeson, to also feature., With increased conversation around the importance of female film-makers, it’s been awfully quiet from the one woman to ever score a best director Oscar. After winning for The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow was snubbed for Zero Dark Thirty, a film some perceived as pro-torture, but her untitled new film could see her become the first female directing nominee since, ermmm, herself. The film in question focuses on the 1967 Detroit riot that claimed the lives of 43 people and saw more than 2,000 buildings destroyed and she’s recruited a buzzy cast, including John Boyega, Straight Outta Compton’s Jason Mitchell and The Revenant’s Will Poulter, to tell the tale., Another Academy mainstay (one win, four nominations to date), Matt Damon could have been up for best actor this year but scheduling conflicts meant he had to give up the lead in Manchester by the Sea to best actor winner Casey Affleck. He still nabbed a nod for producing the drama but 2018 could see him return to the acting categories for one of two new projects. First there’s George Clooney’s 50s-set crime mystery Suburbicon which boasts a script co-penned by the Coens and a cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Oscar Isaac and Josh Brolin. Then there’s Downsizing, Alexander Payne’s satirical comedy about a man who wants to be shrunk which could also see nominations for Kristen Wiig, Alec Baldwin and Christoph Waltz., It’s almost been Chadwick Boseman’s time twice before. Within the space of a year he played both Jackie Robinson and James Brown in 42 and Get On Up respectively but despite both scoring decent reviews, neither was strong enough to become an awards contender. He’s hoping third time’s the charm later this year with another role as a vital figure from black history: this time it’s the first African American justice of the supreme court, Thurgood Marshall. It’s from an unlikely director (Reginald Hudlin whose previous credits are all comedic, including House Party and Boomerang) but it’s fascinating subject matter and has a prime awards season release date this October. , While Rooney Mara did have a role in best picture nominee Lion, it was somewhat thankless, and her other awards-friendly titles of the year (The Secret Scripture, Una) made little impact on the festival circuit. But she’s reuniting with Lion director Garth Davis for her next bid for an Oscar, playing Mary Magdalene in a high-profile new biblical drama. If Davis strikes gold again then the film might also bring awards attention to its other stars Joaquin Phoenix and Chiwetel Ejiofor and could lead to a host of other Bible-based pics on the way., This year’s Oscars might have led to success for a diverse set of winners but one usually rewarded group that was shut out? White British women. That’s likely to change next year though with Academy-adored Judi Dench in the running thanks to period drama Victoria and Abdul. Because if there’s one thing the Oscars love it’s Dench playing dead queens (she’s nabbed one nomination and one win for doing this in the past) and she’s playing Queen Victoria again in a Stephen Frears-directed film about her relationship with a young Indian clerk. She also has a solid track record with Frears: her last nomination was thanks to his film Philomena., While the Academy does have a history of aligning itself to traditional, often staid film-makers, it’s also got a soft spot for some more offbeat choices. Paul Thomas Anderson is such a director, boasting six nominations, and he’s reuniting with Daniel Day-Lewis for his latest, a combination that saw There Will Be Blood score two wins back in 2008. Their untitled latest focuses on London’s fashion world in the 1950s and will most likely see Day-Lewis back in the running as well., Seen as one of last year’s major snubs for his powerful role in Beasts of No Nation, Idris Elba might finally score his first nomination for romantic drama The Mountain Between Us. He’s starring alongside Kate Winslet in a film about two people involved in a plane crash who struggle to survive in the wilderness. The Academy loves a) survival tales and b) films starring Kate Winslet so expect Elba and the film to be major contenders., The only film on this list that people have actually seen so far is Sundance breakout Mudbound, which premiered to rapturous reviews in January. It’s about two families, one black and one white, brought together by the second world war and much of the praise was aimed at singer Mary J Blige, whose previous screen credits have included Black Nativity and Rock of Ages. The film might also see Dee Rees become the first black woman to ever receive a nomination for best director.    0.414642\n",
      "La La Land has taken the top honour at the Toronto film festival. The Los Angeles-set musical world premiered on the opening night film of the Venice film festival and screened in Telluride, before debuting in Toronto. The movie - Damien Chazelle’s third - has attracted raves from reviewers, with especial praise for Emma Stone’s performance as a struggling actor, whose relationship to her jazz pianist boyfriend (Ryan Gosling) becomes strained when his career begins to overtake hers. Stone was named best actress at last Saturday’s Venice film festival awards., The film is the follow-up by Chazelle, 31, to audience-pleasing drumming drama Whiplash, which won three Oscars, including best supporting actor for JK Simmons. La La Land is his second musical, following Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, a little-seen micro-budget jazz musical, originally planned as his thesis project for Harvard Film School (he briefly left Harvard to focus on finishing the film). , “La La Land is about the city I live in, it’s about the music that I grew up playing, it’s about movies that I grew up watching,” Chazelle told the Guardian in Telluride, before screening it in Toronto. “Even the big spectacle of the movie feels private to me in that way.”, The People’s Choice Award is a proven indicator for future awards glory: past winners which have proceeded to the bag the best picture Oscar include Slumdog Millionaire, The King’s Speech and 12 Years a Slave., The runner-up for this year’s prize was Garth Davis’s directorial debut, Lion, starring Dev Patel as a young man adopted as a child who uses Google Maps to track down the family he left in India. The inspirational and fact-based story also stars Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara. Another real-life drama, Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe, about a 10-year-old Ugandan girl who trains to become a world chess champion, took third place., The juried Platform award, established last year to celebrate international auteurs, went to Pablo Larraín’s Jackie, starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy, and unfolding shortly before and after her husband’s assassination. Brian De Palma, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun and Zhang Ziy, who ruled on the prize, said: “Our decision was unanimous. We found one film that combined an extraordinary script with precise direction and unforgettable acting.” The prize comes with a $25,000 prize – $10,000 more than the main winner receives., Ben Wheatley’s Free Fire, a high-profile shoot-up comedy starring Brie Larson and Armie Hammer, won the equivalent of the People’s Choice Award for the Midnight Madness sidebar - a lineup comprised of genre films. The second runner up for the award went to Julia Ducournau’s cannibal thriller Raw, which caused some audience members to faint at its Toronto premiere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.387573\n",
      "Jessica Chastain has criticised the portrayal of women in cinema, saying that the way female characters were depicted in the films she saw at the Cannes film festival was “disturbing”., The actor made her comments at the closing press conference for this year’s festival jury, of which she was a member. , “This is the first time I’ve watched 20 films in 10 days, and I love movies. And the one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women from the female characters that were represented,” she said. “It was quite disturbing to me, to be honest – with some exceptions.”, “I hope when we include female storytellers they will be more like the women I know in my day-to-day life. They are proactive, have their own point of view and don’t just react to men around them,” she added., Cannes has long been criticised for its treatment of female film-makers. Only one woman director, Jane Campion, has won the Palme d’Or in the festival’s 70-year history, a statistic Campion herself recently described as “insane”. However, this year’s festival did recognise two women film-makers, with Lynne Ramsay winning best screenplay for her crime thriller You Were Never Really Here, and Sofia Coppola taking home best director for The Beguiled. Coppola’s win makes her only the second woman to win the award at the festival, after Yuliya Solntseva in 1961., This isn’t the first time Chastain has spoken out about gender imbalance in the film industry. In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year, the actor complained about the lack of female reviewers working in film. , “Critics are the ones who suggest to an audience what stories are valuable or worthwhile,” she said. “When you have 90% of film critics as male, and perhaps not able to review a film from a gender-neutral point of view, we need to understand that we need more female critics to let women and men know that stories about women are just as interesting as stories about men.”, Chastain wasn’t the only jury member to criticise the make-up of this year’s Cannes selection. Actor Will Smith noted the absence of people of colour in the official selection. “A couple of black folks won’t hurt things next year,” he said., The Palme d’Or was won this year by The Square, a satire of the art world by Swedish director Ruben Östlund, while Aids awareness drama 120 Beats Per Minute won the Grand Prix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.360649\n",
      "The Cannes film festival reinforced its status as the home of politically charged cinema with the announcement of a lineup that encompasses the refugee crisis, climate change, mental health and the exploitation of animals. , Celebrating its 70th year, the festival has attracted the usual roster of star names, including Dustin Hoffman, Marion Cotillard and Nicole Kidman, the latter of whom will appear in four films across the festival fortnight. There was also a nod to the future, with concessions made to the growing clout of streaming services Netflix and Amazon, as well as the increased influence of television, with a screening of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks follow-up., Politicised film-making will be present both in and out of competition. Appearing as special screenings at the festival are An Inconvenient Sequel, Al Gore’s continuation of his climate-change documentary An Inconvenient Truth, and a directorial debut for Vanessa Redgrave with Sea Sorrow, a documentary providing historical context to the current migrant crisis. Shoah director Claude Lanzmann returns to the festival with Napalm, a documentary about North Korea, and Raymond Depardon debuts 12 Jours, a documentary filmed in a psychiatric hospital., Among the films competing for the Palme d’Or, meanwhile are Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó’s refugee drama Jupiter’s Moon, Robin Campillo’s 120 Battements par Minute, about the Aids crisis. Bong Joon-Ho’s Okja, a Netflix-funded fantasy film starring Tilda Swinton that was described by Cannes director Thierry Frémaux as “a very political movie” about “the way we exploit animals”., Announcing this year’s lineup, festival president Pierre Lescure maintained the political theme, saying that “since we have a new surprise every day from Donald Trump, I hope Syria and North Korea will not cause a shadow on the festival.”, In the wake of a furore over the apparent airbrushing of actor Claudia Cardinale on this year’s poster, the festival was keen to play up its female-friendly credentials. Twelve female directors will appear at this year’s edition. Three of those are in competition: Scotland’s Lynne Ramsay brings her Joaquin Phoenix-starring drama You Were Never Really Here, about a sex-trafficking ring, to the festival Japanese director Naomi Kawase returns to the festival with Radiance, about a photographer with failing eyesight and Sofia Coppola appears with The Beguiled, a new adaptation of the southern gothic novel, starring Colin Farrell, Kirsten Dunst and Nicole Kidman. Kidman and Farrell also appear in competition with The Lobster director Yorgos Lanthimos’s new film The Killing of a Sacred Deer., Cannes is never short on auteurs and this year’s lineup is no exception. Austrian director Michael Haneke is looking to become the first three-time Palme D’Or winner with his new film Happy End, whose title “doesn’t match the content”, Fremaux quipped. Also present in competition are Fatih Akin with In the Fade, a tale of revenge set in the German-Turkish community, and Cannes regular François Ozon with L’Amant Double, about a woman who falls in love with her psychoanalyst, while eastern Europe is represented by Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa, with the Dostoevsky-inspired A Gentle Creature, and Russian formalist Andrey Zvyagintsev, whose new film Loveless had to be made without funding from his home country after the Russian Culture Ministry were angered by his last film Leviathan., Two legendary directors will be present in spirit, if not in person, at the festival. Nouvelle Vague icon Jean-Luc Godard’s latest film Image et Parole will not appear at Cannes, but Oscar winner Michel Hazanavicius’ biopic of the director, Redoutable, will be in competition. Meanwhile, a new experimental work by the late Abbas Kiarostami, entitled 24 Frames, appears as a special screening., Other notable films appearing in competition include Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories, starring Adam Sandler and Dustin Hoffman (another work supported by Netflix), and Todd Haynes’ Amazon-funded period drama Wonderstruck, while Robert Pattinson makes a return to the festival, starring in Benny and Josh Safdie’s genre movie Good Time. Opening the festival, meanwhile, is Arnaud Desplechin’s relationship drama Les Fantômes d’Ismaël, which stars Marion Cotillard and Charlotte Gainsbourg., Television will also play an unusually large role at this year’s festival, with the first two episodes of the revival of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks and an early screening of series two of Jane Campion’s atmospheric detective drama Top of the Lake, another project featuring Kidman. Cannes has also embraced virtual reality with Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki’s short work Flesh and Sand. Another short film likely to attract attention is Come Swim, which is the directorial debut of actor Kristen Stewart., Bad Education and Julieta director Pedro Almodóvar is president of this year’s jury, which will award the Palme d’Or and the other major prizes. Cristian Mungiu, whose film 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days won the Palme d’Or at the 2007 festival, will head the student and short film jury, while French actor Sandrine Kiberlain will head the Camera d’Or jury., The Cannes film festival will be held from 17-28 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.319700\n",
      "Ryan Gosling has explained the mysterious fit of the giggles he suffered at last month’s Oscars ceremony., The La La Land actor was pictured attempting to hold back laughter as it was revealed that his film had incorrectly been awarded best picture. , Gosling’s giggling attracted considerable attention online, with some contrasting it to the horrified reaction of the rest of La La Land’s cast and crew. But Gosling has explained that he was merely expressing his relief that the disruption on stage wasn’t the result of something more serious., “I was watching people start to have this panicked reaction in the crowd,” he told the Adobe Summit in Las Vegas, according to Entertainment Tonight. “Guys were coming on with headsets and I felt like someone had been hurt., “I thought there was some kind of medical situation, and I had this worst-case scenario playing out in my head. And then I just heard Moonlight won and I was so relieved that I started laughing,” he added., Moonlight was belatedly declared the best picture winner after Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced that La La Land had won the award. It emerged that Warren Beatty, who was presenting the award with Dunaway, had been handed the incorrect envelope by representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountancy firm that oversees Oscars voting. Academy Awards head Cheryl Boone Isaacs later announced that the PWC partners in question, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, would be banned from working at future Oscars ceremonies., Despite the mix-up, Gosling said he was pleased for the eventual best-picture winner. “Truthfully, I was also so thrilled that Moonlight won. It’s such a groundbreaking film, made for a million dollars, an incredible achievement, and I’m so happy for them that they were being recognised,” he said.

      "The MTV movie &amp TV awards have scrapped their best actor and actress categories, instead opting for a single gender-neutral acting category that will be open to both male and female actors., The move comes as part of a major overhaul for the event that will see awards for TV series included for the first time, as well as series and films competing in the same categories. , The nominees for the inaugural best actor in a movie includes Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya, Beauty and the Beast’s Emma Watson, and Hidden Figures’ Taraji P Henson. The best actor in a show category, meanwhile, sees Game of Thrones’s Emilia Clarke compete against Stranger Things’s Millie Bobby Brown and Atlanta’s Donald Glover, among others., MTV’s decision to make their awards gender-neutral comes at a time when the issue of separate male and female acting awards is generating much discussion. This week Asia Kate Dillon, who identifies as gender non-binary, wrote a letter to Emmy awards organisers the Television Academy after they asked which of the best actor or actress categories the Billions star would prefer to be included in. , “I’d like to know if in your eyes ‘actor’ and ‘actress’ denote anatomy or identity and why it is necessary to denote either in the first place?” Dillon wrote. In response, the Academy said that Dillon could apply to whichever category they “more closely identifies as”. Dillon opted for actor, due to its widespread use as a gender-neutral term., Many major awards ceremonies, including the Oscars, Emmys and Baftas, still feature separate categories for men and women, though some have gone gender-neutral in recent years. In 2012 the Grammys eliminated the distinction between male and female performers, instead opting for categories such as best pop vocal performance. The National Television Awards dispensed with gendered categories in 2008, then reverted back to male and female awards in 2012 and 2013, before returning to gender-neutral categories in the years since., Speaking to New York magazine about the decision to dispense with gendered categories, MTV president Chris McCarthy, said. “This audience actually doesn’t see male-female dividing lines, so we said, ‘Let’s take that down.’” , But Melissa Silverstein, founder and editor of Women and Hollywood, a website that advocates for gender equality in film, said that the decision could do more harm than good., “We are all for more inclusivity, especially for people who identify as non-binary, but we caution that this could severely effect female nominees in the future,” she told the Guardian. “We already know that women are severely underrepresented in many categories – only 20% of the non-acting Oscar nominees were women this year – and so if different awards events decide to remove gender identification from categories it is incumbent upon them to work even harder to make sure a full spectrum of people are included in the nominees as well as in the selection committees.”, Leading the way in nominations for the awards is satirical horror film Get Out, which has received seven, including movie of the year and best villain. Disney’s Beauty and the Beast and TV dramas This Is Us and Stranger Things each have four nominations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.299685\n",
      "It’s clear to anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Oscars that winning an award is as much about campaigning as it is about being, you know, good. So while this year’s nominations might have only just been announced, you can bet that studios are already prepping their potential prize horses for next year’s ceremony., This time last year, execs were hoping the following films would be in the conversation, but instead La La Land, Moonlight and Arrival have dominated. Bow your heads for the never-even-rans., While the Academy did find time to bring Mel Gibson back into the fold with a best director nod for the gruesome second world war epic Hacksaw Ridge, another comeback was well and truly denied. It’s not exactly a snub, though: Warren Beatty’s long-gestating Howard Hughes comedy was a bit of a washout, picking up a range of mostly uninterested reviews. Back to the drawing board for another 18 years, then., In contrast with the other films on this list, there’s actually plenty to enjoy in this bitter tale of business and burgers. There’s refreshingly unsentimental career-best work from The Blind Side director John Lee Hancock, a ferocious lead turn from Michael Keaton and an unsparingly bleak look at how McDonald’s actually came to be. But awards have been absent despite the pedigree, and the Weinsteins pushing it, making it a shoulda-been rather than a coulda-been. It’s likely that a film about a hard-edged, amoral businessman mistreating others to craft a business empire isn’t the film people want to see right now ..., Matthew McConaughey has been gradually making a worrying U-turn back towards mediocrity after a laughed-out-of-Cannes turn in Gus Van Sant’s The Sea of Trees led to two failed Oscar-bait projects: the slavery drama Free State of Jones and this underwhelming caper. From Stephen Gaghan, whose two Oscar-touched screenplays for Traffic and Syriana were, well, quite a while ago, this aborted attempt to turn a hunt for gold into a Wolf of Wall Street-esque comedy had once attracted Michael Mann and Spike Lee. Both are probably glad they steered clear, with middling reviews helping to further sink the McConaissance., Last year saw two fact-based films about interracial romance – the subdued yet powerful Loving and this less subdued but still rather stirring drama. Starring Rosamund Pike in her first major lead role since she scored an Oscar nomination for Gone Girl, and David Oyelowo, cruelly snubbed for Selma, it seemed like a done deal. But while reviews were mostly positive, they weren’t ecstatic, most agreeing that while effective, it was all a tad old-fashioned and the film has an awards unfriendly release date in the US next month. Loving didn’t fare much better, scoring just one well-deserved nod for its star Ruth Negga., Ang Lee isn’t a director with a spotless record. If you were one of the few people who accidentally watched Taking Woodstock on cable late one night, then this you know to be true. But after Lee’s second Oscar, this time for Life of Pi, one would expect a great deal more than this awkward misfire, adapted from an award-winning book by Ben Fountain and given a prime slot in the New York film festival. Indeed, no one could have expected just quite how unsuccessful this war on terror drama would be. Hampered by pointless visual tinkering (it boasted a super-high frame rate) and bored reviews, it couldn’t even crack the $2m mark in the US despite a $40m budget. Keep walking, Billy, and don’t you stop., Due to the timing and the scale of the films being screened, Sundance isn’t seen as a typical launchpad for Oscar contenders. But after last year’s festival, it was seen as settled that Nate Parker’s slavery epic would be a major force at the 2017 Oscars. Reviews were mostly ecstatic as the festival coincided with another all-white set of Oscar nominees and Fox forked out a record $17.5m for the rights. But two things happened in the ensuing months: Parker’s college rape accusation came to light and, well outside of the festival frenzy, critics realized that it wasn’t even that good anyway. Parker’s epic fall from grace ended this week with zero Oscar nominations for his flawed film., Remember when you couldn’t leave your house without a stranger forcing you at gunpoint to watch three Jessica Chastain films in a row while agreeing that each was deserving of Oscar buzz? Those days are, thankfully, over – and so it seems is the actor’s ability to garner quite as much attention. Seemingly out of nowhere she emerged with an Oscar nomination for The Help, a role in the Oscar-nominated The Tree of Life and an Oscar nomination for Zero Dark Thirty. Oscar! She also cropped up in the Oscar-nominated The Martian more recently. But a lead role in this horrendously misjudged gun lobby drama is an embarrassing awards plea that removes Chastain from the Oscar conversation entirely. , When Batman v Superman turned out to be even less coherent and even more odious than anyone thought possible, Ben Affleck fans consoled themselves with the knowledge that at least he would end 2016 back in everyone’s good books. His Prohibition-era thriller boasted a strong cast (Affleck himself, Zoe Saldana, Elle Fanning, Chris Cooper, Brendan Gleeson, ermmm ... Miguel) and even stronger source material (his prior Dennis Lehane adaptation was the excellent Gone Baby Gone) but he somehow managed to mess it all up with an alternately undercooked and overcooked mess. It became his worst-reviewed film as director by around 60 percentage points on Rotten Tomatoes. Next up: more Batmanning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.287726\n",
      "Ava DuVernay’s racial inequality documentary The 13th will open the 54th New York film festival, marking the first time a non-fiction film has been chosen to kick off the event., The Netflix project, which debuts globally on the streaming platform and in select theaters on 7 October, examines why the US has produced the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with the majority of those imprisoned being African American. The title of the film refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.”, A statement reported that “the progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass incarceration and the prison industry in the US is laid out by DuVernay” in the documentary., The film is said to be a mix of archival footage and testimonies from activists, politicians and historians, including Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Van Jones, Newt Gingrich, Angela Davis, Senator Cory Booker, Grover Norquist, Khalil Muhammad, Craig DeRoche, Shaka Senghor, Malkia Cyril and Henry Louis Gates Jr., The festival director and selection committee chair, Kent Jones, said in a statement that The 13th is a “great film”, and also “an act of true patriotism”., DuVernay, best known for directing 2014’s Oscar-nominated Selma, had kept The 13th a secret from the public, until Tuesday’s announcement it’s still not listed on her IMDb page., She’s currently prepping her first big-budget film for Disney, an adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s sci-fi classic A Wrinkle in Time, “about a time-traveling black girl traveling through the universe”. Marvel Studios had courted her to take on Black Panther, but she turned it down in favor of making the family film, which resulted in the blockbuster going to Creed director Ryan Coogler., The festival runs from 30 September to 16 October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.286212\n"

      "The new Marvel episode, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, heads so far down the cosmic rabbit hole that you wonder if the saga will ever be able to find its way back to normality, or would ever want to. There are battles with kraken-like inter-dimensional space monsters hyperspace jumps so intense that they bend our heroes’ expressions into cartoonish parodies of themselves even a trip to a bizarre psychedelic planet that (in the human form of Kurt Russell’s Ego) politely informs Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord it is his daddy., Along the way, the Guardians also encounter the golden-skinned Sovereigns, a race of genetically perfect beings whose cowardly use of arcade machine-style drone warfare is a source of much amusement. Equally valuable for comedy purposes is the introduction of Pom Klementieff’s Mantis, a weird-looking alien whose insect-like antennae allow her to glimpse the deepest emotional secrets of her companions. Back in the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), when Tony Stark’s power-suit was the most preposterous story element on show, such additions might have seemed outlandish. But in Marvel’s brave new world of weird, we hardly bat an eyelid., It’s not always been this way. Early superhero movies of the modern era seemed generally disinclined to embrace the wacky cosmic potency of alien-obsessed comics. In 1978, a time when DC mainstays such as Batman, the Green Lantern and the man of steel himself had been taking tea with strange alien races for decades in the comics, Warner Bros released Superman, the first superhero movie of the modern era. Bar a few short opening scenes set on Krypton, it kept Kal-El’s gaze focused firmly on his adopted Earth. Superman II saw the alien General Zod and his snarling minions arrive to do battle, but Superman stayed within Earth’s immediate environs., Later on, Batman would barely leave the Gotham city limits over the course of seven movies under the eye of Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher and Christopher Nolan, while Sony’s Spider-Man trilogy briefly introduced the Venom alien symbiote in Spider-Man 3, only to mess up the moment by failing to hand the famous comic book storyline its proper dues., So how has Marvel shifted the zeitgeist? And why has it taken Hollywood generally so long to embrace the cosmic nuttiness of the sci-fi and magic-obsessed comic book silver age? The answer might lie in Hollywood’s traditional struggles with space fantasy in the wake of Star Wars’ barnstorming box office success in the late 1970s. From 1980’s camp cult curio Flash Gordon to 1987’s execrable Masters of the Universe, with Dolph Lundgren as the kids’ sword-wielding cartoon space hero He-Man, studios have often struggled to rack up the box office greenbacks when venturing into boys’ own extra-terrestrial adventures., More recently in 2012, Disney wrote off $200m following the botched release of the criminally underrated John Carter, based on Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Barsoom novels about a 19th-century Confederate veteran of the civil war who travels to other planets, gains superpowers and romances a beautiful alien princess. A year earlier, Warner Bros’ debut attempt to venture into silver age comic book space fantasy, Green Lantern, had proved even more disastrous. And the studio has not had much more luck since with its fledgling DC Expanded Universe, an attempt to beat Marvel at its own game. Its more outrageous offerings – the alien zombie-clone Doomsday from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Suicide Squad’s gyrating ancient witchy princess The Enchantress – have been among its most deeply unpopular. , So why is Marvel currently getting right what so many film-makers have got wrong over the past 40 years? It can’t just be advances in digital special effects, even though these have undoubtedly helped the studio to depict outlandish fantasy worlds with remarkable verve (as well as ensuring the galaxy no longer has to be populated entirely by conveniently humanoid alien species), because every other studio has access to the same tools. It probably has plenty to do with Marvel’s ability to deliver whip-smart dialogue that helps audiences forget they have just seen a talking space rodent berating a giant walking tree, but the deeper truth is that the Disney-owned studio has been slowly connecting the more eccentric corners of the Marvel galaxy to its less ambitious terrestrial episodes since the beginning. , As far back as 2011, we were introduced to Chris Hemsworth’s Norse god Thor and his Asgardian homeland, with Kenneth Branagh’s movie taking the brave decision to set a full two-thirds of the movie in the CGI heavens, just as it might have been in the comics. The movie was chock full of the kind of nutty cosmic content that made the silver age so popular, from giant blue frost giants to mystical artefacts and magical interplanetary pathways. Marvel’s journey into the weird had begun., The original Guardians of the Galaxy took the studio even further into the extraterrestrial leftfield in 2014, imagining talking raccoons and tree creatures freewheeling through the stars while being chased by blue-skinned space pirates and angry purple gods of death. Then last year’s Doctor Strange began to explore the even stranger magical side of the MCU, as the future Sorcerer Supreme learned to access heavily psychedelic planes of interdimensional, shifting realities., Moreover, the studio’s descent into far-out fantasy has only just begun. The next Avengers movie will see both Strange and the Guardians, who are expected to play a pivotal role, joining up with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes for a battle against the alien deity Thanos (who was first introduced in the first Guardians of the Galaxy film). And the studio president, Kevin Feige, has hinted heavily that the cosmic side of the MCU will only be expanded once Avengers: Infinity War and its as-yet-untitled sequel bring the current phase of Marvel movies to a natural close. As Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 hits cinemas, it seems the movie’s motley gang of assorted space weirdos have moved from the far outer reaches of the Marvel universe to its very core.

      "Does pop culture science fiction merely reflect humanity’s hopes and fears for the future, or can it act as an early warning signal designed to help us avoid the impending techno-apocalypse? It’s hard to imagine anyone ever handing over the nuclear codes to a super-intelligent machine after watching James Cameron’s Terminator films, while movies such as Ex Machina and Blade Runner – and TV shows such as Humans and Westworld – might just make us think twice about the ethics of developing artificial lifeforms merely to satisfy cruel sexual appetites. , If there is a cultural hive mind in place doing its best to help humanity avoid self-destruction in 2017, it appears to be rapidly shifting towards Defcon 1. For this year’s crop of movies is dominated by darkling, sombre and often downright sinister entries: stories in which humans find themselves threatened by otherworldly forces, whether extraterrestrial monstrosities or techno-doppelgangers who can do everything we can do, only better. There is fear everywhere – a sign of the times, perhaps. Even Pixar’s big movie of 2017 is about dead people., There are cheerier entries, of course. Marvel looks likely to continue its box office reign with fantastical tales of interstellar talking rodents, Norse gods and a certain gravity-defying teenage crimefighter. Space opera will continue its comeback with a new Star Wars movie proper and Luc Besson’s first foray into the genre since The Fifth Element (1997). But, in general, the outlook for Hollywood in 2017 is distinctly gloomy. Without further ado, here are my top tips – and a few to avoid., Rupert Sanders’ Ghost in the Shell already feels terribly compromised: a whitewashed cast, a middling director best known for insipid fantasy misfire Snow White and the Huntsman and hints in the trailer that the unsettling visions of humanity’s impending fusion with machines, offered by Mamoru Oshii’s seminal 1995 anime, have been swapped out for a load of tired Hollywood tropes about hidden, forgotten identities. It arrives in March. For a more thoughtful examination of the perils of future technology, James Ponsoldt’s The Circle (based on Dave Eggers’ novel about a company that uses technology to oversee all aspects of human existence) might be worth a look the following month., Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant will hope to rediscover the sense of infernal dread that cut through the original slasher-in-space like a knife, while tying up some of the loose ends that made predecessor Prometheus such an ultimately frustrating affair. What happened to Noomi Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw? Why is Michael Fassbender’s devious David the android now living alone on his planet-wide bachelor pad of evil, and why do the race of Engineers so hate humanity that they keep cooking up new forms of acid-spewing creatures from the seventh layer of Hades to violate us in increasingly awful fashion? Get ready to scream into the cosmos in May. , Is the Planet of the Apes reboot really into its third movie? War for the Planet of the Apes will see Andy Serkis’s meticulously rendered mo-cap primate Caesar taking on Woody Harrelson’s Colonel for control of the post-apocalyptic Earth, and there’s surely no finer actor than the latter for essaying psychopathic intensity. Matt Reeves’ second stint in the director’s chair debuts in July. , It should come as no surprise that Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 looks set to be an even grimmer tale than Scott’s original 1982 dystopian masterpiece. The debut teaser does at least suggest that Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard lived rather longer than his replicant brothers and sisters – a development that will need to be explained – but future Los Angeles’ jaded cityscapes remain clouded in an eternal dusk, and even the once glorious Tyrell pyramid appears to have been swallowed by the desert. New blade runner Ryan Gosling begins his mission to save a world that already looks pretty screwed in October., It’s also worth mentioning a pair of thrillers set in space. God Particle, from newcomer Julius Onah, is the third instalment in the very-loosely-connected-indeed Cloverfield saga, following on from last year’s sinister 10 Cloverfield Lane. This time the aftermath of the monster attack on New York finds us in a space station floating above Earth, as an international crew of astronauts tries to work out why the planet beneath them appears to have suddenly vanished. The film debuts in October., On a similar tip, Daniel Espinosa’s Life will see International Space Station astronauts Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Ryan Reynolds grapple with the discovery of a mysterious sample taken from the surface of Mars that might hold the key to proving the existence of extraterrestrial life. That one arrives in March., The remarkable success of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story suggests audiences continue to be inspired by movies straddling the divide between science fiction and fantasy. Throw in the quick-fire inter-superhero badinage of Marvel’s Avengers films and you have James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, which is due a second outing in May. The comedy highlight this time around is expected to be Vin Diesel’s Baby Groot, who has regressed to infancy after the events of the first film and now boasts a toddler-esque penchant for mischief. , Who knows if Star Wars’ resurgence inspired Besson to return to the genre that ushered in perhaps his greatest triumph more than two decades after The Fifth Element debuted in cinemas, in the supremely ambitious-looking Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. What is certain is that the French fantasy maestro is taking a galaxy-sized risk punting €180m (£153m, the biggest ever budget for a French film) on Cara Delevingne delivering a better performance than she did in the execrable Suicide Squad. , Delevingne plays Laureline, partner to Dane DeHaan’s time-and space-travelling super agent: in the long-running graphic novels, she emerges as the series’ real star. Fingers crossed the film succeeds by injecting some Gallic whimsy into the genre and doesn’t go the same way as that other well-intentioned but ultimately failed attempt to expand the template, the Wachowskis’ Jupiter Ascending. Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets debuts in July., Finally, the big one: Rian Johnson’s still-untitled Star Wars: Episode VIII. Will we finally discover the truth about Rey’s mysterious past? Can Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker – this will be our first chance to see the galaxy’s last living Jedi knight in action since 1983 – still cut it with a lightsaber? And how will Disney go about giving Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia a suitable – preferably non-CGI-assisted – send-off? We’ll find out in mid-December., With comic book movies having shifted into grown-up territory, The Lego Batman Movie is probably the only superhero film suitable for small children out this year. Fortunately, Chris McKay’s film looks set to have the beating of most of its contemporaries, thanks largely to Will Arnett’s wonderfully tongue-in-cheek turn as the tiny, plastic, lobster thermidore-munching caped crusader. It’s a follow-up to 2014 smash hit The Lego Movie, and it’s out next month. What a pity Power Rangers, to be released in March, appears to have eschewed a similar meta-infused approach for a gloomy, furrow-browed adaptation of the brilliantly super-kitsch TV show., There’s no X-Men movie out this year, but James Mangold’s Logan, featuring Hugh Jackman in his (supposedly) final turn as an older, weakened Wolverine, should fill the gap nicely. Quite how influenced the movie will be by Mark Millar’s classic graphic novel Old Man Logan remains to be seen. There are hints it may be closely influenced by more recent Marvel comics in which a female clone of Wolverine, X-23, takes over the adamantium-clawed mutant’s role. Logan arrives in March. , The new, Warner Bros-funded DC Expanded Universe has two episodes out in 2017. Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman arrives first, in March, and will hope to give the film series an Amazonian kick up the backside after the disastrous double whammy of Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The latter’s director, Zack Snyder, promises he’s learned from his mistakes and will give us a more sympathetic Batfleck in November’s Justice League. If neither film achieves critical traction, it’s hard to see how future efforts such as The Flash and Aquaman can be expected to drive all before them., Rival studio Marvel is also doubling up this year. Spider-Man: Homecoming, out in July, will see Tom Holland’s callow wall-crawler earning his superhero stripes as Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man looks on proudly in between dodgy cracks about the continuing attractiveness of Marisa Tomei’s evergreen Aunt May. Then in November we get the return of Chris Hemsworth’s Norse hunk Thor for a Planet Hulk-inspired road trip through the cosmos in the rumoured company of Mark Ruffalo’s not-so-jolly green giant and Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. There are also reports that Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange could be along for the ride. , Due in June, The Mummy is a strange beast. It looks like a typical Tom Cruise action movie of the past decade, as he is joined once again by an attractive younger female companion (this time Annabelle Wallis) who will no doubt get plenty of screen time and no small portion of the action. But it’s also intended to be the starting point for a Marvel-style “cinematic universe” built around Universal’s monster movies, with Russell Crowe as a Nick Fury-like Dr Henry Jekyll investigating the emergence of various strange creatures in the modern day. Quite whether The Invisible Man and Frankenstein’s Monster can team up without recalling awful memories of Abbott and Costello’s silly 1950s capers in the company of various past-their-best beasties remains to be seen., We’ve seen every type of King Arthur tale from whimsical Disney animated musical (The Sword in the Stone) to doom-drenched, mud-caked mediaeval fantasy (Excalibur) on the big screen. Now Guy Ritchie brings us a version in which cheeky cockney tyke Arthur biffs his way through the entire cast of Game of Thrones in a suspiciously mega-populated version of dark ages Britain. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword arrives in May, and looks as if it might be fun., Those longing to see Idris Elba in a genuinely beefy lead role only need wait until July, when the Hackney-born Englishman stars as gunslinger Roland Deschain in Nikolaj Arcel’s adaptation of/sequel to Stephen King’s venerable series of sprawling fantasy novels, The Dark Tower. This one’s been a long time coming, and a $60m budget suggests an element of compromise. But Arcel has a credible back catalogue (2012’s A Royal Affair won two Silver Bears at Berlin), even if he’s not quite got the industry stature of JJ Abrams or Ron Howard, both of whom had been attached to direct., Pixar has two movies out in 2017. Cars 3 looks like exactly the kind of insipid sequel the pioneering studio promised it would never make, but studio chief John Lasseter is a renowned petrolhead and these films generate billions in merchandise profits. By contrast, Lee Unkrich’s Coco probably has the bravest, most daring setup for a kids’ movie since Up. It’s all about the Mexican Day of the Dead ceremony, and will see a 12-year-old boy set off on an adventure that culminates in a remarkable family reunion – no doubt involving gazillions of colourful skeletons and a trip to the fiery depths of Hades. I told you 2017 was going to be dark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.385428\n",
      "Matt Damon once said the only superhero he would ever consider playing was Marvel’s Daredevil, and only if Christopher Nolan agreed to direct. But that was before best pal Ben Affleck was handed the keys to the Batmobile., Speaking at the UK premiere of Jason Bourne, Damon revealed he would consider pulling on the spandex provided Affleck made the offer, and didn’t go snagging the best role for himself. Which got us thinking about how the 45-year-old Oscar-winner would fit into the all-new DC expanded universe if his friend ever makes the call. Here are five colourful comic book titans that might just suit Damon down to the ground., If Affleck wanted to bring the man of steel to Gotham, who better to step into Kal-El’s red and blue spandex than his old pal Matt? Damon certainly has the right combination of musclebound brawn and plain old ultra-decency to play the big blue boy scout. And the Bourne star surely isn’t going to sign up for a bit part: he’ll want to play the main man, the big cheese, the boss daddy of the DC megaverse. Anything less would be an insult., Chances: 1/10. Despite the appalling critical response to Batman v Superman: Yawn of Justice, Henry Cavill surely has his fingers firmly on the role for a while yet. And at 5 ft 10in, Damon is just too tiny to play Superman opposite 6 ft 4in Affleck without the aid of serious CGI. Or stilts. Casting him as the last son of Krypton would be like handing the role to Nicolas Cage, or choosing Bill Murray to play Batman. What’s that you say?, Now we’re talking. Oliver McQueen is a perennial comrade of Batman in the comics, but has the spunk and standing to tell the caped crusader when his Batcave stinks, so Damon and Affleck would meet as relative equals. If Warner Bros chose to stick with the golden age take on the superhero, Matt might even get to rock up with his own Arrowcar, Arrowcave and Robin-style teenaged sidekick. , Chances: 7/10. Green Arrow isn’t lined up to appear in next year’s Justice League, even though he often plays a vital part in the superhero ensemble in the comics. And there is little or no chance of Warner Bros parachuting in Stephen Amell from the middling The CW TV show Arrow, so the job’s up for grabs., If Damon really wants to be Robin to Affleck’s Batman, this is probably the closest he’s ever going to get. Zack Snyder may have essentially killed off the boy wonder in Yawn of Justice, but if we’re following the comic book source material it’s pretty clear the Jason Todd iteration was the one who got copped by the Joker. The first Robin, Dick Grayson, might well be running around Gotham as Nightwing doing his independent, Batman-inspired crimefighting thing by this point., Chances: 4/10. Nightwing has become well established over the decades as one of DC’s top superheroes, and even doubled for his former partner when Batman’s back was broken by Bane. But Grayson was once Bruce Wayne’s ward, and the pair are often painted as having a father-son style relationship, which for Affleck and Damon might prove a little awkward to say the least., Here’s another perennial stalwart of the Justice League conspicuous by his absence from the upcoming Warner/DC slate. The green-skinned alien has been described by Superman as the most powerful being on Earth, and has often stood in for the man of steel when he’s been about other business. Surely Damon would enjoy picking up a skillset that includes telepathy, super-strength and speed, telekinesis, invisibility and shapeshifting just for starters? But would he really be up for spending all those hours in the make-up chair?, Chances: 6/10. Only if they let Damon do it by motion capture., A superhero that even Ryan Reynolds couldn’t make look cool is a tough sell indeed, so it’s no wonder DC Films has pushed the intergalactic space cop so far to the rear of its superhero slate that it will probably take us light years to get there (well, at least until 2020). But if Marvel can make the cosmic freaks of Guardians of the Galaxy into A-list heroes, Warner ought to be able to do something similar with Hal Jordan and his magic power ring. Damon has the comic gifts to help elevate the sometime Justice League member to the top ranks of big screen superheroes, and he and Batman have always had an entertaining rivalry. , Chances: 6/10. Green Lantern’s not the most obvious hero to appear in a Batman movie, and power rings are essentially deeply silly. So much so that the original 1940s Lantern was invulnerable to all weapons, bar those made from wood. Which makes us think it’s a good thing he rarely comes up against Green Arrow.

      "If Ryan Reynolds is trying to stoke enthusiasm for a future Deadpool versus Wolverine movie he’s going about it the right way. The new short film that accompanies James Mangold’s Logan in cinemas – now also available to view online – features Reynolds’ foul-mouthed mutant strolling past posters of Jackman’s current blockbuster and cracking funnies about the adamantium-clawed antihero’s lack of a proper superhero suit. It’s a timely reminder that 20th Century Fox has more than one big hitter in its X-Men-centred saga., The small matter of Jackman’s supposed retirement from the role of Wolverine, not to mention certain climactic events that take place during Logan, do rather complicate the prospect of a joint outing. But given that Mangold’s movie takes place in 2029 and Deadpool is presumably set in the present day, there’s plenty of time for a rousing prequel featuring both mutants. In many ways, the pair are the perfect odd couple, Reynolds’ Deadpool irreverent, cocky and garrulous to a fault Jackman’s Wolverine possessing features that often seem permanently fixed in an Eastwoodesque scowl. The duo have previously teamed up in the comics, and both mutants are currently operating within an R-rated sphere that makes them highly compatible on the big screen. Jackman has previously spoken out against the idea, but that was before Logan cleaned up at the global box office this weekend with an earth-shattering $237.8m worldwide., Moreover, the buddy superhero flick is already well on its way to becoming a thing. Marvel Studios has lined up Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk and Chris Hemsworth’s son of Odin for a cosmic road trip in November’s Thor: Ragnarok. And there’s the small matter of July’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, with Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man expected to operate as Peter Parker’s middle-aged sidekick. These movies offer the inter-superhero badinage adored by fans, without the need for foggy, epic-scale storylines in which the fine details of individual heroes’ eccentricities inevitably tend to get lost., The emergence of Wolverine and Deadpool as the big beasts of the X-Verse is timely, as Fox producer Lauren Shuler Donner admits in a new interview with Vanity Fair that the saga cannot continue telling the story of Professor X’s eternal battle with Magneto forever. While there’s still the small matter of a mooted 90s-set X-Men movie titled Supernova, it looks likely that the duelling frenemies will soon be allowed to take a back seat while others move to the fore. X-Men: First Class successfully reinvigorated the franchise in 2011 by presenting the pair’s path from friendship to enmity for the first time in a previous timeline, as well as recasting the roles of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). But the relative failure of last year’s X-Men: Apocalypse, which briefly reduced Magneto to the title villain’s minion, suggests Fox’s writers are fast running out of ideas. , This should hardly be a surprise. We’ve now seen Professor X and Magneto marshalling their chess pieces in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 2000s and 2020s in six movies stretching over the best part of two decades. There remain a half century’s worth of unfilmed stories in the comic books, but the question is whether audiences – right now – have any sort of appetite for them. Fox has also rather hamstrung itself by delivering two standalone efforts whose quality shows up the most recent X-Men outing, rather than encouraging audiences to catch future instalments of the main saga., This is a problem for Fox if it hopes to ape the success of rival Marvel. The unique selling point of the Disney-owned studio’s pioneering cinematic universe is that filmgoers can be confident each instalment sits within the same continuity and has (usually) been made with the same level of care and attention as its predecessors. By contrast, Logan and Deadpool both seem to exist within their own bubble, and there is no guarantee that the studio’s next ensemble outing will get the box-office bounce from either that, say, Iron Man 3 got from the success of The Avengers in 2012., The logical answer would be for Fox to take the gritty vibe of its R-rated movies and create a mini-cinematic universe set in the present day, with Deadpool and Wolverine at its centre. Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique, a surefire box-office titan if she can be prepared to return, could be recruited to join in, since the shapeshifting mutant ages more gradually than normal human beings and would presumably still look young in 2017. Fox also has plans for an X-Force movie, potentially led by Reynolds, and there has been talk of films based on the Alpha Flight and Exiles comics. Taken together, these would be more than enough to form the core of a new shared universe. , Patrick Stewart has never been better as Xavier than as a dilapidated, mentally fading nonagenarian version of the powerful mutant in Logan, a development that is telling. It’s as if Stewart has been freed from the rigid cage of Professor X’s eternal war with Magneto, allowing him to finally find the soul of the X-Men’s mentor at the umpteenth time of asking. This is hardly a shock: no other superhero saga has kept the same double act going for so long: it’s as if Batman had battled the Joker in every movie since his 1966 big-screen debut., By dispensing with Professor X and Magneto, at least for a while, Fox would be following in the footsteps of Marvel, which appears to be slowly moving towards a world without the usual leaders of The Avengers, Chris Evans’ Captain America and Downey Jr’s Iron Man. If both superheroes survive beyond the events of the forthcoming Infinity War double header, it will most likely be in semi-retired form, and this is entirely sensible. Audiences eventually get fatigue when the same stories are recycled over and over again, a problem that’s at the heart of the DCEU’s current travails. Zack Snyder’s gun-toting, Harley Quinn punching version of Batman was reimagined in order to differentiate Batfleck from the popular Christian Bale take on the dark knight, the latter having retired the cape and cowl only a few years previously. Likewise, Henry Cavill’s Superman is a strangely insipid, overly modernised version of Kal-El precisely because producers fear repeating the mistakes of 2006’s Superman Returns, a movie that riffed too heavily on Christopher Reeve’s wonderfully nuanced performances as the big blue boy scout in the late 70s and 80s., Unlike Warner Bros, which is pitching its entire expanded universe around Bats and Supes, Fox now has a unique opportunity to place the most famous members of its universe on hiatus without damaging its overall brand, thanks to the success of Logan and Deadpool. It’s a chance the studio should seize with both hands.

      "This weekend saw good and bad news for Warner Bros, a studio desperately in need of the former. Their highly anticipated antihero adventure Suicide Squad made over $267m worldwide in its opening weekend, breaking an August record in the US and helping to fight back against the negative reviews the film had received. Because yeah, about those reviews ..., Critical reception for Suicide Squad has been super-bad, with the film scraping together a measly 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, making the film even less liked than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After Zack Snyder’s superhero smackdown crash-landed in March, Suicide Squad was retooled and repositioned as the film’s wittier, hipper sibling, aimed at restoring faith in a DC universe that was slowly falling apart., But while fans like the film slightly more (it scored a B+ with audiences, compared with Batman v Superman’s B), it’s already suffering from poisonous word of mouth. After over-performing on Thursday night and Friday in the US, it suffered a steep decline on the Saturday with a 41% drop (in comparison, Captain America: Civil War fell just 19%)., It’s the final underwhelming blockbuster of what’s been an underwhelming season at the cinema after last year’s record summer. But what’s been going wrong?, Ever since the Avengers assembled across multiple movies, every other studio has been eagerly brainstorming ways to turn a linear franchise into a criss-crossing “cinematic universe”. Those two words have been attached to everything from the Fast &amp Furious series to Hasbro’s films. This year has seen Warners’ DC masterplan start to collapse, with their attempt to replicate Marvel’s impressive handiwork feeling laboured. While Captain America, Iron Man and their cohorts zipped around effortlessly from film to film, Batman and Superman have sluggishly stomped between efforts, grimly smashing everything in their sights., It’s not exactly breaking news that studios are eager for cash, but cinematic universes have made them blind, deaf and dumb with greed. The sharp drop-offs for both Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad show that anticipation and brand awareness will only get you so far, and that audiences, savvy enough to understand what’s being constructed beyond the framework of the film they’re watching, need something more to maintain their interest. Everything now hinges on next year for Warners, with Wonder Woman and Justice League testing both the loyalty of their fanbase and the studio’s ability to learn from their mistakes., The growing importance of the Chinese market, and studios’ pandering to overseas audiences to ensure added profits, have never been more noticeable than during this year’s set of blockbusters. Independence Day: Resurgence crowbarred in two Chinese characters, lines of dialogue in Chinese and prominent placement of the Chinese drink Moon Milk, while around one-third of Now You See Me 2 was set in Macau., Now, adding some internationality to the often dull uniformity of American blockbusters is no bad thing, but these decisions aren’t led by creative impulses. A blockbuster that feels like a commercial product is hardly a unicorn, but the Chinese influence is making movies feel more mechanical than ever before., The only thing a studio wants more than a successful sequel is a film so successful that it will need a sequel of its own. This summer, Universal, coming off a record year, hoped that its ambitiously titled video-game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning would launch a new set of related films, but the $160m adventure was a washout in the US, making less than $50m. It might have clawed back some cash in China, but local interest has been so poor that a sequel is unlikely., Warners was also hoping that an umpteenth Tarzan film would lead to further adventures, but current box office suggests otherwise. A $335m global total is no disaster but with a $180m budget attached, making more jungle-set capers would be a risky decision. The Nice Guys was also given one of the most blatantly open endings of the season but, despite strong reviews, it failed to catch on with audiences so more instalments seem unlikely. The original films that have secured sequels this season are The Secret Life of Pets and Lights Out, showing that animation and horror are still the most reliable genres in the business., While audiences and critics were happy to see a sequel to Finding Nemo (Finding Dory has become the biggest animated film of all time in the US), they’ve been less impressed with most other sequels offered up this summer. Globally, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows made less than half of the original’s surprise $493m take Alice Through the Looking Glass made less than a third of Alice in Wonderland’s $1bn total and The Huntsman: Winter’s War made just $164m in comparison to the $396m that Snow White brought in., The first Alice and Snow White films worked because of the awareness that their title characters brought with them, but audiences were less familiar with anything that came after (the Huntsman plot was an entirely new invention), while a Ninja Turtles sequel was hardly at the top of anyone’s wish-list. Even no-brainers under-performed, such as X-Men: Apocalypse ($534m to Future Past’s $747m) and Ice Age: Collision Course ($288m to Continental Drift’s $877m), suggesting a general franchise boredom. But all of these films had one other thing in common ..., It’s the most obvious point to be making but one of the major problems this season is that Hollywood just isn’t making good films. The battle to lure audiences away from Netflix was temporarily won last year thanks to event movies that were loved by fans and critics (Star Wars: The Force Awakens Jurassic World Inside Out The Martian) but this year’s crop has seen a major dip in quality. Angry DC fans tried to shut down Rotten Tomatoes last week after the negative Suicide Squad reviews, but the film’s sharp drop-off shows the reviews were representative of the film’s general lousiness., With audiences tweeting their reactions, good word of mouth is even more important, which explains why the films that have succeeded this summer have been the ones that have benefited from critical support. The season’s biggest hit, Finding Dory, has a 94% Rotten Tomatoes rating, Captain America: Civil War boasts 90%, while surprise smash The Secret Life of Pets is up to 75%. That two of these three hits are animated, along with Zootropolis’ huge $1bn take in March (a film which had a 98% rating), also indicate that children remain the most reliable demographic., The success of Zootropolis, along with pre-summer 2016 hits The Jungle Book, The Revenant and Deadpool, also shows that seasons have shifted at the box office. The summer months and the Christmas period are no longer the only times when studios unleash their major releases. Audiences are no longer saving up until June but are splashing out on Imax and 3D surcharges all year round. , This summer might have been a disappointment, but this spring definitely wasn’t, and this autumn and winter, bringing along new Star Wars and Harry Potter spin-offs, is unlikely to be either ...

      "Is the blockbuster in trouble? On the surface, to suggest such a thing might seem as foolish as handing out the wrong envelope at the biggest event of the film calendar because you were busy tweeting pictures of Emma Stone. This is the blockbuster we’re talking about. It’s Luke Skywalker, Jurassic World, Disney, The Avengers, Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Pixar. It’s the Rock punching his fist through a building. It’s the effects-driven cultural juggernaut that powers the entire film industry. Does it look as if it’s in trouble?, A glance at the balance sheet for the year to date would cement the view that the blockbuster is in rude health. Total grosses are higher at this stage than any of the past five years. Logan, the Lego Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island have all pulled in big audiences globally. And then there’s Beauty and the Beast, a true cultural phenomenon, currently racing its way up the all-time rankings. All this and there’s still a new Star Wars instalment, another Spider-Man reboot, Wonder Woman, Justice League, Alien: Covenant, Blade Runner 2049, plus sequels of (*deep breath*) Guardians of the Galaxy, Cars, World War Z, Kingsman, Transformers, Fast and the Furious, Planet of the Apes, Despicable Me, Thor and Pirates of the Caribbean still to come. Hardly the signs of a crisis, it would be fair to say., Dig a little deeper though and the foundations that blockbusters are built on start to look shaky. Last month, Variety published a story that painted a picture of an industry “scared stiff” by its own future, as consumer tastes adapt with changes in technology. Increased pressure from Netflix and Amazon, those digital-disruption barbarians, has caused the big studios to consider changing the way they release movies. The “theatrical window”, the 90-day cushion between a film’s debut in cinemas and its release on DVD or streaming, is set to be reduced to as little as three weeks in an attempt to bolster dwindling home entertainment sales. It’s a move that the industry sees as necessary, as younger viewers develop more adaptable, portable viewing methods, and indeed many smaller productions have begun to release their films on-demand on the same day as in cinemas – it was one of the reasons that Shia LaBeouf’s Man Down grossed a much-mocked £7 in cinemas., At the same time, investors from China – long thought to be Hollywood’s saviour – have suddenly cooled their interest, cancelling major studio deals as the Chinese box office suffers growing pains (with domestic ticket sales only increasing 2.4% in 2016 against a 49% rise the year before) and the government’s crackdown on overseas investment starts to bite. Add to that a couple of high-profile recent flops – Scarlett Johansson’s Ghost in the Shell, Matt Damon’s The Great Wall, the unintentionally creepy Chris Pratt/Jennifer Lawerence sci-fi Passengers, Jake Gyllenhaal’s Alien knock-off Life – and you have an industry that’s not as thriving as the blockbuster bluster might suggest., Hollywood’s response to this instability has been to double down, focusing on blockbusters to the exclusion of just about everything else. In the past decade the summer blockbuster season has mission-crept its way well into spring, a phenomenon that has been termed “cultural global warming” this year, Logan was released a mere three days after the Oscars ended. The resulting effect is of a full calendar year of blockbusters, with a small drop-off for Oscars season in January and February – and even in that period this year we still saw the releases of The Lego Batman Movie, The Great Wall, John Wick 2 and the lamentable Monster Trucks., Meanwhile, the mid-budget film – that hardy perennial that used to help prop up the industry by costing relatively little and often earning lots (think Sophie’s Choice or LA Confidential) has largely been abandoned by the major studios, its potential profit margins seen as insufficiently high when the cost of things such as marketing is factored in. Which isn’t to say that mid-budget films don’t exist, it’s just that they’re being made by smaller, independent studios – see Arrival and Get Out for recent successful examples – or most frequently as TV series. (There’s that Netflix, disrupting things again.), In essence, what this all means for the industry is that it’s blockbuster or bust. Studios have looked at the shifting landscape and decided to react by filling it with superheroes, action stars and CGI creatures, making more blockbusters than they used to, but fewer films in total. The old tentpole formula, where a few big films would shelter the mid-range and low-budget stuff, has largely been abandoned. “The blockbusters are about reducing the films these studios produce down to a minimum,” say Steven Gaydos, vice-president and executive editor at Variety. “They make nothing but big bets. You have to keep building a bigger and better spaceship.”, It’s a high-risk strategy and one that, in the form of Disney and their Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar franchises, has brought big rewards. But this sudden ratcheting up of the stakes means that the cost of failure has become far more pronounced. Last year Viacom was forced to take a $115m (£92m) writedown on Monster Trucks, while Sony took a writedown of nearly $1bn on their entire film division after a faltering couple of years., While those losses might be explained away as the result of bad bets on bad films – Monster Trucks was infamously based on an idea by an executive’s five-year-old son – they hint at the apocalypse that could ensue if a broader, industry-wide problem were to present itself. Namely, what if the public loses its appetite for the blockbuster?, It’s not entirely without precedent: in the late 1950s, as television threatened to steal a march on cinema, studios responded by going big. Spectacle was seen as the key: westerns, musicals and sword-and-sandal epics dominated. But audiences soon grew tired of these hackneyed genres and ticket sales continued to dwindle. That time the industry survived, thanks first to the injection of vitality provided by the edgy, arty New Hollywood films, then later with the early blockbusters such as Jaws and Star Wars., Could such a mass tuning-out happen again? Certainly, there’s an eerie echo in the way that Hollywood has reacted to changing times with size and spectacle, but also in their narrow focus. Once an erotic thriller such as Fatal Attraction or a musical drama such as Footloose might have reasonably been considered a blockbuster. Nowadays the blockbuster almost exclusively resides in the action, fantasy, kids’ film or superhero genres., The superhero film in particular looms large over the industry, as every studio tries to replicate the formula set by Marvel. Ever-more niche caped crusaders are being given their own films – Batgirl, Aquaman, the Gotham City Sirens – in an attempt to unearth a new Deadpool. Spider-Man and Batman have once again been rebooted in an attempt to freshen up the respective franchises. And, of course, everyone wants their own “cinematic universe” – a vast galaxy of characters that together can generate a seemingly infinite number of spin-offs, sequels and prequels. At this very moment, the creators of Call of Duty are actively seeking to turn their grisly shoot-em-ups into a series of interlocking films, while James Cameron – a director whose preferred method of cracking a nut is with a sledgehammer, you suspect – is creating a universe around his smash-hit Avatar, replete with five sequels, graphic novels, actual novels and, most bewilderingly, a Cirque du Soleil show., These shared universes actively court the sort of audiences who will turn up to every film, buy the action figures, don the cosplay outfits and eat the branded breakfast cereal – in other words, teenage boys. “The dominant ideology is fanboy culture,” says Gaydos. “It is adolescent. It is conflict resolution by violence. It is wish-fulfillment, spectacle and diversion – sound and fury, if we want to get Shakespearean.”, Truly, the geeks have inherited the earth. But what about the rest of us? How many people have the time, energy or inclination to sit through, say, all the films in the forthcoming Universal Monsters shared universe, which begins this year with a reboot of The Mummy and has revivals of Wolf Man, Van Helsing and the Invisible Man in pre-production? Greenlighting this series of films without knowing whether anyone is going to bother to watch even the first of them looks like a risky endeavour, and the recent plight of the Divergent YA film franchise, whose latest film is being released as a TV movie due to lack of interest, offers up a cautionary tale that studios should perhaps be paying attention to., But what’s striking about all these blockbusters is how youth-skewed they are, at a time when a third of cinemagoers in the US are over the age of 50. Older audiences can enjoy The Avengers as much as everyone else, of course, but pitching your market primarily towards young people is a risky strategy. Young people tend to be the most fickle audience, one whose attention “is split in a million places”, says Gaydos. They’re also the audience least able to splash out on cinema tickets. And of course they’re an audience who are becoming increasingly accustomed to watching content on their phones, laptops and smart TVs., In other words, they’re the ones likely to force through the seismic change the industry is currently fretting over. If they lose interest in the modern blockbuster in the way that younger audiences turned away from the westerns, musicals and historical epics in the 1960s, the studios will have to find something shiny and new to wave in their faces – and this time they won’t have something akin to the New Hollywood to court them with, as that sort of transgressive, edgy, groundbreaking fare is increasingly turning up on the small screen., Perhaps the best thing the studios can do in the face of this new world is to show some imagination in how they develop and present their blockbusters – and there are signs that this is already happening. Producer Stephen Woolley, who has worked on films such as The Crying Game and the forthcoming adaptation of On Chesil Beach, cites Deadpool as a film that has subtly managed to shift the perception of the superhero movie. “It’s taking a much more sophisticated view of that world and ridiculing it, while at the same reinforcing it. It was a clever have-your-cake-and-eat-it from the people who created it.”, Meanwhile, Disney’s successful live-action reimaginings of their animated works – most notably Beauty and the Beast and The Jungle Book – suggests that it’s possible to play the sequels and remakes game without it feeling like a retread over old ground. Most remarkably of all, the musical seems to be making a comeback with the success of La La Land, that rare mid-budget movie to have crossed over into blockbuster status, grossing more than $400m at a budget of $37m., Woolley is aware of the risks swirling around the blockbuster, but feels that mass extinction is still some way away, if it ever comes. “The danger you have is that audiences are fickle, and they could suddenly turn off,” he says. “Something happens for them to say: ‘Actually, we don’t like those movies any more.’ And there’s always this inkling that it might happen. But every time it seems to happen on the blockbuster front, another movie comes out to prove you wrong.”, Ultimately, though, what might keep the blockbuster safe for the time being is not the films themselves but all the stuff around them. “The thing that the studios are making is something akin to a hypermovie or a supermovie,” says Gaydos. “It’s a whole other thing. It’s a toy-delivery system. A Cars movie will gross $500m or $600m but the Cars products will sell $4bn. Ultimately the movie is designed to be a giant marketing tool for merchandise and theme parks that generate billions and billions.”, As Hollywood agonises over its own future, it might be that the best way for the blockbuster to survive is to subsume itself into bigger, more secure revenue streams: toys, games, merchandise, live attractions. So if you want to keep the blockbuster around for a while longer, you should get your Superman costume on and pour yourself a bowl of that branded cereal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.326404\n",
      "Spider-Man’s impish cameo in Captain America: Civil War turned doubters into true believers. After two middling Amazing Spider-Man movies starring the unfortunate Andrew Garfield, Marvel managed to make the masked wall-crawler feel fresh again, merely by introducing him into a more colourful and diverse universe of superheroes where Spidey is no longer required to beat up Flash Thompson, or grieve for Uncle Ben, every second movie., But can the Disney-owned studio restore the webslinger to his rightful position on the tallest plinth in the comic book movie pantheon when he no longer has dozens of former or future Avengers for company? Here are eight takeaways from our first look at Spider-Man: Homecoming., As promised by Marvel, this is a genuinely green, high school-age wall-crawler. Unlike either of his big-screen predecessors – Tobey Maguire was 27 when he first played the role Andrew Garfield 29 – at 20 years old, British actor Tom Holland looks like he really could still be a teenager. That marks Spider-Man: Homecoming out nicely from the rest of the rapidly-aging MCU and ensures the new Peter Parker needn’t be rushed into full-time membership of The Avengers., Thanks to a previous teaser trailer, we already knew that the all-new, all-different Spidey is continuing to get tactical support from Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark following the events of Civil War. Presumably this Steve Ditko-inspired winged suit is useful when you’re taking on a menacing flying monster, otherwise known as Michael Keaton’s villainous Vulture., Marvel’s ability to show Iron Man’s gradual transition from arrogant overreacher to chastened stick-in-the-mud over the course of a half dozen movies may just be one of the most impressive aspects of its pioneering cinematic universe. During his run as the power-suited hero, Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark has saved the world from alien invaders, then helped usher in an artificial intelligence that nearly destroyed the planet. The genius billionaire has fought alongside Captain America, then battled against the patriotic hero. So it should come as no surprise that he makes a rather hesitant mentor to Peter Parker, especially as Stark isn’t really the avuncular type. Where’s Nick Fury when you need him?, Stark suddenly seems unsure whether Parker’s ready for superhero duties, which seems a bit rich given he was ready to call on the MCU’s newest hero to battle the likes of Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Falcon during the events of Civil War. There has been some suggestion that Spider-Man: Homecoming might straddle the events of the earlier episode, rather than taking place after it, which would make sense of the older man’s cautious approach., Bad villains have always killed Spider-Man movies, from The Amazing Spider-Man’s poorly-rendered Lizard to the awful triple whammy of Venom, Sandman and James Franco’s junior Green Goblin in Sam Raimi’s ill-fated final turn in the hot seat, Spider-Man 3. But Michael Keaton’s Vulture, all hellish insectoid carapace, freaky machine-mask and those infernal emerald peepers, already looks like an impressively scary specimen. He may not be the most famous of Spidey villains, but Keaton’s first comic book movie turn since 1992’s Batman Returns could change all that in a whisk of those matte-black wings., The fanboy blogosphere (including myself) – and even the great Stan Lee – might need to ready ourselves for a giant egg-on-face moment. When usually reliable Hollywood trade bible The Wrap “confirmed” in August that the pop star and actor would be playing Peter Parker’s perennial paramour, the news generated scores of pieces praising the casting of an African American actor in the traditionally Anglo-Saxon role., The only problem is, Zendaya doesn’t appear to be playing MJ after all: the distinctly non-red-headed young woman berating Peter Parker and his pal in the trailer is rumoured to be named Michele. Could she be Michele Gonzalez, room-mate and sometime love interest for Spidey in the comics? To be fair, Zendaya has continued to insist that she is not playing MJ, and it’s looking increasingly unlikely that this is yet another example of “I am Khan”-style smoke and mirrors., Making Mary Jane mixed-race made sense because Queens, where Spidey lives and goes to school, boasted a non-Hispanic white population of just 26.2% in 2014, the date of the most recent census. But looking around the new Midtown high, this does seem to be a more realistic rendition than we’ve seen before in the Sony movies. Parker’s best friend Ned Leeds is played by the Asian American actor Jacob Batalon, while rumored love interest Liz Allan is portrayed by African American actor Laura Harrier. An even better known member of the Spidey supporting cast, Flash Thompson, will be played by The Grand Budapest Hotel’s splendid Tony Revolori, who is of Guatemalan descent. , Regular Marvel observers wondered if Tony Stark might keep the power-suits firmly locked away for a while in the wake of Civil War’s bruising inter-superhero battles. But given the cost of hiring Downey Jr, it was probably inevitable that Iron Man would find himself swooping through the Manhattan skyline at some point. Is the Vulture simply too powerful for one teenage superhero to take down alone?

      "Superheroes often come from humble origins. Peter Parker was a simple high school geek before a bite from a radioactive spider transformed him into Spider-Man. Captain America was a scrawny weakling who became the ultimate warrior after being injected with a super-serum. The classic origins tale for Wonder Woman, perhaps the most famous female superhero in DC’s grand pantheon of costumed crimefighters, is that she was sculpted from clay by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, and given life by the Greek goddess Athena. , Creating something fabulous from meagre raw materials is something the Power Rangers director, Dean Israelite, clearly knows all about, for the new movie about five teenagers transformed into brightly coloured defenders of Earth is the ultimate example of polishing a turd. Even the most hardcore fan of the long-running kids’ show would surely accept that it is ropey in the extreme: in fact, this is part of the series’ essential charm. Culled from episodes of the nutso Japanese show Super Sentai, which provides the dazzling fight sequences, Power Rangers often features acting so bad that the experience of watching it has a so-bad-it’s-good quality, like viewing terribly dubbed 70s martial arts movies or early Russ Meyer flicks. , While the current big hitters in superhero movies – Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man – are often based on work by seminal writers of the comic book milieu, Power Rangers was dreamed up by Haim Saban, whose “genius” was simply spotting Super Sentai and deciding to borrow all the best bits for a new US show. Smart business acumen, yes, but hardly evidence of sparkling creativity on a level with the likes of Stan Lee, Bob Kane or Jack Kirby. , Watching Power Rangers is therefore a slightly sobering experience for fans of the genre used to leafing through the pages of much-loved graphic novels in order to note the slightest of textual references in the latest Joss Whedon or Christopher Nolan effort. For Israelite’s movie is one of the best superhero movies of the year so far without any roots in Marvel or DC’s back catalogue, and there’s a depth of characterisation here that equals anything we’ve seen in recent comic book efforts. , Origins stories about superhero teams are always a slog, because the audience has to be introduced to multiple characters in quickfire fashion. But long before 20 minutes of Power Rangers are up, the movie has utilised smart Hollywood shorthand to let us know that the Red Ranger, Jason, is a kind-hearted anti-jock, the Blue Ranger, Billy, is an enthusiastic techno geek with autism, and the Pink Ranger, Kimberly, is a reckless outsider who struggles to fit in. This might seem like the bare minimum required to make us care about the team’s alien-bashing antics, but it’s a lot more than we got in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice or Suicide Squad, and these are episodes that dealt with some of the most celebrated costumed crimefighters of all time. , The Power Rangers story is mind-bogglingly simple. In the show’s early seasons, the five rangers find their energems – magic stones that give them their powers – meet their mentor, Zordon, and fight the evil alien Rita Repulsa and her invasion of freaky monsters. The movie is pretty much the same, but Israelite has supercharged the special effects: the chief beastie, Goldar, now looks like the golden cousin of Gandalf’s nemesis the Balrog from Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings, where the original was a shouty blue gorilla in a silly costume. Zordon no longer looks like he’s talking to the Rangers through a towel the Bryan Cranston-voiced version manifests as a very cool digital, ever-shifting wall of blocks in the shape of the Breaking Bad star’s face. , Power Rangers unquestionably follows the Marvel route to success: using just the right amount of self-reflexive smarts and crackling badinage to paper over the high-octane silliness. Early trailers appeared to suggest that Israelite’s film would plump for an ill-advised dark and brooding take on the formula, but the final result is as bright and breezy as the best Spider-Man movies, if a little overlong at two hours plus. It’s also a rare live action superhero flick you can take the kids to without having to shield their eyes during the more inappropriate moments. As Deadpool and Logan shift the genre into ever-more mature territory, Lionsgate has wisely spotted a gap in the market., The rise of superhero movies has lent comic books an air of artistic stature that they did not have 30 years ago: graphic novels are seen as the rarefied raw material upon which studios thrive, rather than pulpy trash for bored teenagers. The geek has inherited the Earth. But Hollywood surely needs to ask itself why so many comic book movies with celebrated source material are failing, when Power Rangers triumphs despite its cheap origins. , Perhaps the answer lies in Israelite’s willingness to throw a loving embrace around the show’s hokey roots, to celebrate the show’s mad-as-a-box-of-spiders shtick rather than trying to reinvent it. By contrast, Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad tried to give us all-new takes on Batman and Harley Quinn, making the former a gun-toting bully ruled by his emotions and the latter little more than eye candy. But there is also a distinct shift away from the sense of comic book source material as hallowed ground here., Zack Snyder’s Dawn of Justice features entire scenes cribbed from the classic Frank Miller graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, as well as heavy hints at the controversial A Death in the Family comic book series, but it was still a disaster. Meanwhile, Power Rangers gives us superheroes whose lowly roots lie in a famously trashy kids’ TV show. The lesson here seems to be that film-makers who use comic book riffs to try and keep the fanboys happy run the risk of alienating their audiences, while those who take the far less risky approach of adapting unheralded material can end up polishing that turd so hard that it shines like a diamond.

      "Given the repetitive influx of superhero films in recent years, you’d be forgiven for wanting very little to do with anything involving a cape, a mask and a post-credits teaser for a long time. But wait, the R-rated Wolverine sequel Logan hits cinemas this week and critics agree that it’s worth getting over yourself for., Many are saying it will join the ranks of the all-time greats but what else should be on this list? Here are seven of the best from Guardian writers., Was 2004 the superheroes’ annus mirabilis? That was when Marvel Studios initiated its ambitious plan to self-finance its movies, buy back the rights to characters such as Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and begin the 21st-century wave of superhero films, hugely popular with the public, but often patronised and dismissed the way westerns used to be., But something else happened in 2004: the release of Pixar’s glorious animated superhero homage The Incredibles. That’s a film which doesn’t fit easily into the superhero fanbase-constituency, and is part of neither the Marvel nor DC tribe (unless you count the fact that Pixar, like Marvel, is part of Disney). And I’m conscious that in calling it a “homage” I may even now be denying it full superhero-film status. But a brilliant superhero film is what it is – riffing on the X-Men and Fantastic Four – with superb characters, a great supervillain, a terrific story and a sharp satiric theme on the subject of excellence, and the nature of risk, jeopardy and the state., Mr Incredible (voiced by Craig T Nelson) is a lantern-jawed, barrel-chested superhero who plies his trade in the 1940s, the superheroes’ postwar first-generation comic book heyday. He is fighting alongside his fiancee, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). When a member of the public sues him for preventing his suicide, it triggers a legal nightmare forcing the government to outlaw superheroism and to relocate “supers” to other cities with new identities and bland normality. Twenty years later, he and Elastigirl have suburban lives and he works in insurance – a nightmarish perversion of his former calling. They have two kids whose superpowers they have to conceal at school. But then a new villain emerges with a secret connection to the Incredibles’ past, forcing them to reclaim their vocation – and their destiny., It is rightly celebrated for the superhero costumière, Edna Mode, voiced by the director and writer, Brad Bird, who thinks that capes are a bad idea and is passionately committed to her contemporary vision: “I never look back, darling it distracts from the now.” There is a wonderful passage on the phenomenon of supervillains “monologuing” – huge third-act set-piece speeches in which the villains talk about themselves and their awful vision., Actually, in 2017, the non-talky streamlined all-action superhero film is pretty much against both capes and monologuing and also against Edna Mode’s injunction against looking back. Superhero films love origin myths, elaborate retro sequences from the past and all-around ancestor worship., But as it happens, and incredible as it may sound, The Incredibles has a brilliant action sequence, as exciting as anything in any live-action superhero film or action film. Elastigirl and the two kids are flying in their plane to an island from which the errant Mr Incredible has sent a distress signal. Then she is attacked by rockets. The subsequent “chase” scene and midair explosion are absolutely nail-biting., It is witty, smart, visually ravishing, and its generic insights are celebratory, not derisive. What a great superhero film. PB, I have to be honest: I am not the world’s biggest superhero movie fan. Put another way, when they took off in the late 80s, I thought they were a fad that would blow over in a few years more fool me. In fact, the elevation to ever-prolonging ubiquity is one of the great mysteries of contemporary cinema: how this genre, that for years was considered only good for doltish teens, and treated with equivalent lack of respect, has steadily evolved into the mainstay of the global film industry. Be that as it may, I prefer the funny, candy-coloured type of superhero movie (Spider-Man, Thor, Deadpool) rather than the furrowed-brow earnestathons (Batman Begins, Captain America, Man of Steel) – I’ve never seen a superhero movie weighty or nuanced enough to justify the heavy-duty treatment., But as films – as opposed to moving comic-books – superhero movies tend to fall down pretty hard. There are great sequences, brilliant set pieces, very nice shots – but they rarely hold together, still less allowing actual narrative subtlety to intrude on the scene-shifting. The first – and still, by my reckoning, only – time that a superhero movie seemed way ahead of everything else was the first Tim Burton Batman, from 1989. A tour de force of design, cinematography, and cinematic texture, it was light years ahead of (the nevertheless highly enjoyable) Superman films that had blazed the superhero trail in the 1970s and 80s. Burton’s brilliance was to make everything else look redundant – and in many ways, nothing has changed since. AP, Here’s a conspiracy theory: someone at the Academy purposefully shuffled those envelopes to detract from the much bigger scandal earlier in the evening: the snubbing of Garry Shandling in this year’s Oscars In Memoriam montage. I hope my choice of the Marvel movie in which he cameos as a sinister Hydra disciple will go some way to righting this wrong. , Shandling’s 15-second appearance in this sequel to the first film featuring the weed who becomes the most fantastic hunk is one of my chief reasons for picking it the other is it’s literally the only superhero movie I can ever really remember enjoying., This is obviously a personal deficit, but perhaps it is, actually, a better superhero movie than most? There are terrific action sequences, for a start: that initial heist, fuelled with sexual tension between the Cap and the Black Widow, plus the most wonderful punch-up in a lift. Plus, vegetables to accompany all that meat and beef: a properly thought-provoking investigation of the morals of surveillance and the ethics of vigilantism in a democratically accountable society., But perhaps what really clinched it for me as an Avengers movie I could get along with was the relative dearth of Robert Downey Jr. The more you can minimise this man, the more I shall like any movie. CS, Many are hailing Logan for stretching the boundaries of what a superhero movie can be. It’s dramatic, fervid, and realistic in its violence. But let’s not do away with what’s core to comics culture: deep, dank nerdery that ought not be allowed to see daylight., I love comic books rich in lore and steeped in mythos, swirling in and out of realms with names impossible to spell. Thor: The Dark World stuffs two handfuls of delicious dorkiness into its maw, one rich in fantasy, the other in science fiction. Is the Asgardian bio-bed a quantum field generator or a “Soul Forge”? The answer, of course, is that it is both., Thor: The Dark World has portals and Kronan Rock Men and invisible spaceships and a ray that can curl you up into a singularity and zap you into another dimension. A liquid totem called the Aether is almost in Malekith the Dark Elf’s nefarious grasp, just in time for the quinquennial cosmic event known as the Convergence. Oh, God, I need to stop typing and grab my asthma inhaler, this sort of talk gets me all worked up., In the middle of all this, there’s the bickering romance between the sharp and sweet doctor played by Natalie Portman and her hunky blonde blue-eyed spaceman, Thor. When they reunite during a battle, the first thing she does is yell at him for never calling. When they visit Thor’s realm, Dr Foster quickly bonds with Thor’s mother. They may as well be eating intergalactic coffee cake. And there are still some who say mixed marriages can’t work?!?, Thor: The Dark World is a rush of Absolute Comics mainlined direct to my amygdala, with a profound purity that few other modern superhero movies allow themselves. It is Worthy. JH, While Batman Begins was a refreshingly coherent, mature and dark-hued film about the Caped Crusader (a relief after the eye-punishing gaudy excess of Batman &amp Robin), it was far from a masterpiece. , There was a major villain problem (a somewhat gimmicky last act switcheroo that didn’t quite have the required impact) and a major Katie Holmes problem (needs no explanation) and as a result, it was a promising franchise-restarter but not the home run we might have hoped for. Three years later, Christopher Nolan returned, lessons learned and homework done, with a sequel that rose far above its generic peers and, despite the creation of the hero-packed DC and Marvel universes since, it easily remains unsurpassed. , The Dark Knight moves like a fiendish thriller, one that confidently pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre in a way that comic book fans may be familiar with but which for cinema-goers such as myself was a revelation. It’s a breathtakingly brutal film, packed with staggering PG-13 violence and a bleak worldview that’s unrelenting, grounding fantastical characters and situations in a world that, for once, is depressingly easy to relate to., That villain problem? Easily fixed. The casting of Heath Ledger in the role of the Joker might have been initially unpopular with fans, who couldn’t envision his leading man looks buried under cartoonish makeup, but his performance was dynamite, an Oscar-winning fireball of anger and anarchy. That Katie Holmes problem? Replaced. Maggie Gyllenhaal added depth and a genuine emotional connection which led to the shocking finale carrying even greater weight. It’s one of the rare examples of a superhero film where each devastating act of violence or aggression has a lasting impact. In Nolan’s Gotham City, life and death both mean something., It might be to blame for the dreary drudgery that’s bogged down many ensuing superhero adventures but it remains a ruthlessly entertaining example of just how daring and necessary the genre can be. BL, It may be difficult to credit given Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice recently picked up a gaggle of Razzies, but Zack Snyder was once seen as the coming man of comic book movies. His 2009 adaptation of Alan Moore’s sprawling graphic novel about an alternative 1980s in which Nixon remains in power and superheroes are real remains a high point of the film-maker’s career – and proof that given a decent script, he is capable of producing eye-popping cinema beyond that of most his contemporaries. , The bravura opening montage, set to the strains of Bob Dylan’s The Times They Are A Changin’, is unequalled in comic book movies. The casting is impeccable: Jackie Earl Haley has never been better than as the hardboiled, morally immovable vigilante Rorschach, a gurning, spitting man out of time whose psychological torment is written on his face whether wearing that famous mask or not. Patrick Wilson is wonderfully understated as the taciturn Nite Owl, a superhero who looks like an accountant with middle-aged spread, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as the leering, sneering, cigar-smoking alpha male scumbag the Comedian, a role which surely won him the part of the villain Negan in The Walking Dead. , Naysayers argue that Watchmen is too close to its source material, bar a sensibly altered denouement. But Moore’s story is so epic in scale and splendid in its unexpectedly detailed rendering of the inner psyches of costumed crimefighters that Snyder was really only required to add visual flare. If there is a Citizen Kane of superhero movies, this is indisputably it. BC, The best thing about this time traveling entry into the vast annals of X-Men history is the absolute disregard Bryan Singer had for newcomers. If you hadn’t been paying attention to his line of mutant entertainment over the last decade or so, you’d feel a bit like Kyle Reese being spat out into 1984 with no clothes and no idea what was happening. That slightly manic pace, which feels like it’s borrowed from a daytime soap opera, plus the period costume and references to Vietnam, Nixon and the height of 70s cold war paranoia made this a strangely daring superhero film. , Instead of something that tried to set out the basic idea of what the X-Men were and what they were all about – a concept most grandmothers could probably grasp by now – this just got straight into the internal machinations of a group that makes the EU look harmonious. Of course, the old themes of good and evil doing battle, and overcoming personal demons (in this case addiction for Professor X) are there, but it was delivered in a knowingly strange way. You could even argue the hectic feel and funny but slightly smug lines set the stage for the least superhero-y superhero of them all, Deadpool. Singer knew fans were au fait with the concept of time travel, and would love to see Magneto and Professor X as their younger selves, so he threw it all into a blender and Days of Future Past came out like a perfectly mixed bit of superhero bechamel.

      "Batman has always been defined by his Batwear. Tim Burton ushered in a new era for Gotham’s dark knight by jettisoning the familiar colour scheme sported by Adam West in the much-loved 1960s show in favour of typically gothic black and an armored, musclebound look. George Clooney’s awful Batnipples, intended as a paean to classical visions of the gods, came to define the floundering Joel Schumacher years. With Ben Affleck sporting a new goggled look in the upcoming Justice League, we look back at Batman’s classiest capes and darkest sartorial disasters., The camp tone of the 1966-68 show and its 1966 spin-off movie heavily inspired West’s outfit, featuring a short cape because the actor’s co-stars kept stepping on it in slapstick-inspired action scenes, and painted-on eyebrows (serving to give the dark knight an eternally surprised expression), presumably to avoid the expense of moulding the caped crusader’s brow-line into the famous cowl. To be fair to West and the show’s writers, it is hard to look menacing when you’re wearing your underpants over a pair of tights, so a comic approach was probably advisable. And at least Batman’s bargain bin gold utility belt always seemed to contain exactly the right weapon of choice to take down the relevant member of the caped crusader’s rogues’ gallery., Five-foot-10, 160-pound Keaton might not have been the obvious choice to play Gotham’s terrifying defender in the Tim Burton films, but who needs endless trips to the gym and a diet of raw eggs and protein powder when moulded rubber muscles and a fearsomely beaky cowl can serve just as well? Nevertheless, with the new black Batsuit featuring a design based on unyielding foam rubber that extended to his skull, the actor was faced with a whole new set of problems. Legend has it that the caped crusader’s famous “hero turn” in 1989’s Batman and its 1991 sequel Batman Returns came about because Keaton simply had no alternative. The rigid suit meant he was physically incapable of turning his head., Gorgeous George might be best known for ruining the dark knight for a generation with those superimposed nipples in 1997’s execrable Batman &amp Robin, but Kilmer had them first (if not quite so pronounced) in 1995’s almost equally hideous Batman Forever. Clooney definitely wins the prize for worst Batman suit of all time, however, in the shape of the silver and blue outfit worn by our hero and his Batpals in the denouement of Joel Schumacher’s much-maligned final turn in the director’s chair. This time there are not just nipples on show, but an enormous sculpted, excruciatingly outlined Batcodpiece. We should also mention that a different version of the suit features pop-out ice skates, essential for taking on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr Freeze, or simply terrifying small children at your local rink. , A welcome return to sanity arrived in the shape of Christopher Nolan’s tech-inspired Batsuits for the Dark Knight trilogy, supposedly based on a discontinued Wayne Enterprises design for an armored military bodysuit that Bruce Wayne initially just paints black and sticks a Batsymbol on in 2005’s Batman Begins. But the most sensible revolution, after close to two decades of caped crusaders who are unable to really turn their heads, came with 2008’s The Dark Knight. Apparently at the behest of Christian Bale, who found the costume uncomfortable, Morgan Freeman’s Lucius Fox simply develops a cowl that’s only loosely connected to the rest of the suit. Yes, it only took 19 years for Batman and his team to work out the importance of flexibility and actual peripheral vision when risking one’s life every night on the grim and bloody streets of Gotham., If West’s fabric-based suit, which has often been retained for the comics, makes the actor look slightly pudgy when compared to the statuesque physicality of some of his successors, Affleck was preposterously accused of being fat when he first pulled on his new Dark Knight Returns-inspired costume, supposedly made from a mix of kevlar and titanium but still with a cloth-like appearance, for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. , The truth is that a return to the woven look of Bill Finger-era Bats required the new dark knight to be in ridiculously impressive shape. A rather easier pitch was the movie’s mech-suit, inspired by the armor worn by Batman for his battle with Superman in Frank Miller’s seminal 1986 graphic novel., And now here’s a third suit for Batfleck, which really is approaching Edna Mode levels of sartorial superhero extravagance. This one will be rolled out for Snyder’s Justice League and reminds us of the begoggled look sported by Patrick Wilson’s Nite Owl in Snyder’s splendid 2009 superhero epic Watchmen. Rumour has it that it features additional metal plating to allow Batman to take more of a pounding from his enemies, which sounds like a good idea after one of those Gotham scumbags managed to plunge a knife straight through the dark knight’s costume and into his arm last time out.



      "As we inch towards day 100 of his ignoble reign, it is becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump is going to remain president of the United States for a fair while yet (bar a sudden and unlikely show of courage from Republican politicians). Which means at some point we’ll have to start thinking about those big questions around the legacy of POTUS 45. What, for example, will a Trump presidential library look like? Will it contain three books or four? Which of the faces on Mount Rushmore is Trump going to replace with his own visage? And most importantly of all, for film fans at least – who will direct Trump: The Movie?, Because make no mistake, there will be a Trump movie. We’re only a few months into his presidency and already HBO have announced that a miniseries about his election win is in the works. From cable news to late-night chat shows, television has turned the Trump presidency into a licence to print money, which you have to imagine is attracting envious glances from the film industry. Surely it’s not a question of if but when – and of who should direct it., Certainly, there is no shortage of people who could lay claim to being the best auteur for the job of depicting the Donald. Michael Bay would surely capture the explosive bombast of the man – plus he seems to love trucks as much as Trump himself. Oliver Stone, meanwhile, has already tackled three different presidents in JFK, Nixon and George W Bush, and his paranoid style looks well-matched to the conspiracy-theorising of the current presidency. Kathryn Bigelow looks best suited to illustrate the bruising results of Trump’s foreign-policy follies. (This is the man who wants to seize Iraq’s oil, lest we forget.) Mike Judge is often cited as the director whose work most eerily predicted Trump’s rise with his film Idiocracy. Christopher Nolan has the dubious honour of having possibly inspired the rhetoric of Trump’s own inauguration speech. And then there are the film-makers who could claim unique insight into Trump’s mindset, having directed the man himself in such cinematic titans as Home Alone 2, Little Rascals and – of course – Ghosts Can Do It., In my opinion though, there’s only one director who could really pull off a Trump biopic, and that’s Werner Herzog. The austere German director is more than qualified. Consider the evidence. The temptation with a Trump film would be to make it polemical, and amp up his grotesque nature. The thing is, we’ve had an awful lot of that already. Would another depiction of Trump as a one-dimensional monster really add anything? What we need is someone who treats Trump with clinical detachment. Herzog tends to approach his subjects in the manner of a lepidopterist pinning butterflies to a board, and Trump would be no different, judging by an interview the director gave with Rolling Stone last week., “He’s the first time you have a real independent,” Herzog said. “He’s turned against the Republican party, and he’s vehemently against the media, justifiably so to some degree, and I find this a very significant novelty. It’s mysterious how Trump is getting away with literally everything. I see it with great, strange fascination. Very, very unusual.”, Herzog’s fascination with Trump is unsurprising, because in a sense he’s been making films about people like him for much of his career. Herzog has always had a preoccupation with wild, often irrational ambition, particularly in his collaborations with Klaus Kinski – who would have made a cracking Trump, FYI. Glimpses of the president’s defining characteristics can be seen in the protagonists of Aguirre, the Wrath of God, or Fitzcarraldo. Trump is precisely the sort of person to have a steamship dragged up the side of a mountain, you suspect., Another of Herzog’s recurring cinematic themes – man’s fierce battle with nature – would apply quite well to Trump too, given the potentially devastating ideological war he’s currently waging on the planet by dismantling environmental regulations, elevating climate change deniers to prominent cabinet positions and even deleting scientific data relating to global warming in the Arctic. Herzog has witnessed the results of such wrongheadedness firsthand in his documentary Encounters at the End of the World, so he’d be well-placed to depict the destruction Trump is likely to wreak., And, of course, Herzog loves an unhappy ending, from Woyzeck to Aguirre to The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, and there’s a fair chance of one of those – for Trump or for the rest of us - at the conclusion of this presidency (though it’s unlikely he’ll get eaten by a bear, a la Grizzly Man). So, yes, Herzog is the only choice of director for our Trump biopic. Now we just need someone to star in it. Nicolas Cage, anyone?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.675196\n",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has ruled out a run for the US Senate, in response to widespread speculation that the actor would return to political life to take on Donald Trump., Schwarzenegger, who was governor of California from 2003 to 2011, had been tipped by political insiders to enter the 2018 race for the US Senate, either as a Republican or an independent, in a move that would have given him a public platform to oppose Trump’s presidency. However, Schwarzenegger refuted the rumours in a Facebook post published on Sunday, suggesting instead that he would continue his battle against political gerrymandering., “I’m deeply flattered by all of the people who have approached me about running for Senate, but my mission right now is to bring sanity to Washington through redistricting reform like we passed here in California,” he wrote. “Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions., “Thank you for your kind messages and all of the support and I hope you’ll join me in my battle against gerrymandering with the same enthusiasm.”, Schwarzenegger has long been a vocal critic of Trump, supporting Trump’s opponent John Kasich in the Republican primaries and later announcing that he wouldn’t vote for Trump as president, following the release of a widely condemned recording in which Trump boasted about groping women. It was the first time that Schwarzenegger had not voted for a Republican candidate for president since he became a US citizen in 1983., A Twitter feud between the pair has intensified in the weeks following Trump’s swearing in as president. Trump mocked the ratings of his successor as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, and Schwarzenegger suggested in response that the two men should swap jobs, so that “people can finally sleep comfortably again”. , Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice, blaming Trump’s continued involvement in the show, as executive producer, for its poor ratings. Trump in turn claimed in a tweet that Schwarzenegger had not resigned but had been “fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings.... Sad end to great show”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.560876\n",
      "Fortuitously timed doesn’t begin to describe the release of this new Netflix documentary about America’s smear-campaigner-in-chief Roger Stone. It lands on the streaming platform at the end of a week in which the man who the lobbyist and consultant first introduced to politics, Donald Trump, fired the very person investigating him for collusion with Russia: FBI head James Comey. And the man who, it’s reported, encouraged Trump to sack Comey? One Roger Stone, who is himself being investigated over his own links with Russia., Even if Stone wasn’t sat at the centre of what is potentially the biggest political scandal in American history, he would still be deserving of a documentary profile. This, after all, is the man who journalist Jeffrey Toobin describes as “the sinister Forrest Gump of American politics”. Stone has had a perma-tanned hand in just about every nefarious deed carried out by the forces of the American conservative movement in the past half century, from Watergate right up to the election of perhaps the least qualified man in history to hold the office of US president. He also practically invented the modern political attack ad and engaged in the dirtiest of dirty tricks. There’s a reason Stone has the acquired the eye-opening nickname, “Ratfucker”., Even more remarkable than that soubriquet is the fact that Stone has carried out this reign of terror not in the manner of a shadowy Koch-brothers-style figure, but as someone who gleefully courts press, positive or otherwise. A “bodybuilding dandy” (another excellent Toobin description) with a taste for loud suits and even louder media appearances – not to mention a tattoo of Nixon’s disembodied head on the square of his back – Stone is the sort of extrovert figure that documentarians pray to their altar of Errol Morris DVDs to one day get to make a film about., The danger then for directors Dylan Bank and Daniel DiMauro is that they treat Stone as a docu-curiosity rather than subjecting him, and the craven political culture he has brought about, to proper scrutiny. The engrossing Get Me Roger Stone avoids this pitfall, just about. Certainly there are plenty of scenes of Stone pontificating to camera – and far too many shots of him shirtless – but there’s also a thorough history of Stone’s many misdeeds, from encouraging a riot at a polling station central to Al Gore’s chances of winning a recount vote in the contested 2000 election, to his lobbying group Black, Manafort and Stone’s representation of genocidal dictators across the globe. (Yes, the Manafort there is Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager and another individual whose links with Russia are being thoroughly pored over at present.), Providing context to this sea of misdemeanours is an impressive range of talking heads from across the political spectrum. One one side there’s lifelong Stone sceptics like Toobin and investigative reporter Wayne Barrett, who did more than most to expose Stone’s wrongdoings and who passed away earlier this year. (Stone marked Barrett’s passing with a tweet urging him to “rot in hell”, proof if any were needed that he was that rare figure who truly got Stone worked up.) On the other, conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson, plus Stone acolytes like Manafort, and in a rather impressive get – though perhaps not, given his addiction to self-publicity – the current president of the United States., It’s fair to say that without Roger Stone, you don’t get President Trump. Stone boarded the Trump train as early as the 1980s and encouraged the business mogul to run for political office several times before last year’s presidential bid. It’s that campaign that makes up the final third of this documentary, providing an extended look at just how central Stone was to Trump’s eventual success. Officially Stone left the campaign in 2015, after a falling-out with then-campaign manager Cory Lewandowski. In reality though, he remained a not-so silent partner all the way through to Trump’s eventual victory, denouncing the Donald’s opponents on live TV, spreading wild conspiracy theories about Hillary and Bill Clinton on Alex Jones’s grotesque Infowars network and generally making as much of a nuisance of himself as possible. It all culminates here in the grim spectacle of election night, and Trump’s final triumph, toasted by Stone and Jones in the Infowars studio., If there is a major shortcoming here it’s that the documentary fades to black right at the point of those celebrations. You suspect that Stone’s story doesn’t end there, but instead with the full revelations about what he did and didn’t know about the campaign’s alleged involvement with the Russians. Sadly that aspect of Stone’s recent history goes largely unremarked upon. The only other problem with Get Me Roger Stone is the queasy realisation at the end of it that Stone himself would revel in the fact that so many people will be watching and seething silently at this documentary. There’s no such thing as bad publicity, after all.    0.437225\n",
      "The polls tighten. The fear rises. And there could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this., Five years ago, British director Anthony Baxter made a Michael Moore-esque documentary about the obnoxious arrogance of Donald J Trump, who was vandalising a coastline of natural beauty near Aberdeen to build a golf course, in so doing making promises on job creation and finding a useful idiot in Alex Salmond, who had rolled over with the necessary political permissions. In the course of all this, Trump’s building workers had cut off the water supply to an elderly, courageous widow, Mrs Molly Forbes, and her son Michael. The Forbes family had refused to sell up. Now, five years later, Baxter has returned to find this water supply has still not been restored., The point about Trump’s grisly Scottish adventure is that it’s a very real dummy run for what he would be like as an international statesman in the arena of politics and diplomacy. Of course he is a mendacious sociopath, and he has far too easily coerced forelock-tugging UK officials into doing his bidding. When Trump talks about bringing the private business style into politics, this is what he means: corporate lawyers attacking local communities and breaking promises on jobs, supposedly the cornerstone of what passes for Trump’s political vision. What on earth is Nicola Sturgeon doing about this? Or Scottish Secretary David Mundell? Whatever happens in the US presidential election, it is time for them to stand up for Mrs Molly Forbes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.433006\n",
      "Robert Redford has said that Donald Trump has taken Richard Nixon’s attacks on journalism to “new and dangerous heights”, in a column written for the Washington Post., In the article, titled 45 Years After Watergate, the Truth Is Again in Danger, the actor writes of his concerns that, if a political scandal similar to the one that brought down Nixon occurred today, it might not be “navigated” as well due to the public’s “tenuous grasp on truth”., Redford is more familiar than most with Watergate. In 1976 he played Post journalist Bob Woodward in All the President’s Men, Alan J Pakula’s film about the attempts by Woodward and Carl Bernstein (played by Dustin Hoffman) to investigate the scandal that would ultimately force Nixon to resign from the presidency., “This year marks the 45th anniversary of the Watergate scandal,” he writes in the article. “Because of my role in the film, some have asked me about the similarities between our situations in 1972 and 2017. There are many. The biggest one is the importance of a free and independent media in defending our democracy., “When President Trump speaks of being in a ‘running war’ with the media, calls them ‘among the most dishonest human beings on Earth’ and tweets that they’re the ‘enemy of the American people,’ his language takes the Nixon administration’s false accusations of ‘shoddy’ and ‘shabby’ journalism to new and dangerous heights.”, Redford writes that Nixon stepped down because of “bravery and honesty by Americans across the political spectrum. There was a time during a period of national crisis when politicians from both sides of the aisle put partisan politics aside to uncover the truth”., But Redford is concerned that in today’s “divided” America, things might be different., “If we have another Watergate, will we navigate it as well? In a statement in May 1973, John Dean [Nixon’s counsel, who went on to testify against the President in front of a grand jury] addressed what he described as efforts to discredit his testimony by discrediting him personally. He famously said: ‘The truth always emerges.’ I’m concerned about its chances these days.”, In 2015, Redford was forced to deny that he had endorsed Trump for president after Trump tweeted a quote from Redford that spoke positively of the then-Republican primary candidate. “He enjoys him but not for president,” a rep for the actor told the Hollywood Reporter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.394440\n",
      "Joss Whedon has brought out a startlingly star-crammed anti-Trump video, featuring what the film itself cheerfully calls “a shit-ton of famous people”, including Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Keegan-Michael Key, Julianne Moore, Stanley Tucci and Martin Sheen – all talking directly to camera, with the obligatory viral-video “holding-up-a-slogan-written-on-paper” moment., It is hedged with a kind of self-aware and self-mocking irony – and the way it satirises just this kind of video is actually pretty funny: particularly the moment when an ordinary, non-famous person is brought on to lend weight and dignity to the parade of celebrity flibbertigibbets., But watching it is a strange experience: what difference will it actually make, and to whom? This is not technically a campaign ad, but a video for a Super Pac or political action committee – which is allowed to raise funds for political campaigns independently – called Save the Day. It is about the democratic importance of exercising your vote, and does not tell America explicitly who to vote for in so many words, although the anti-Trump message is plain. One of the stars is Mark Ruffalo, who featured very prominently on a recent, not dissimilar pro-Bernie Sanders video – for the now utterly forgotten ReLoveLution campaign., Of course, there is no inconsistency in Ruffalo appearing in both. Sanders gracefully withdrew from the Democratic candidature and asked his partisans to throw their weight behind Clinton and against Donald Trump. But it shows how ephemeral these online videos can be., And what’s the point? The point is getting out the vote using celeb firepower, persuading young people to register and urging Democrat waverers that the hour of crisis is at hand, that every vote counts, and that residual Sanders-ist disaffection with the whole mainstream process has to be put aside for the purposes of keeping a dangerous racist and fascist out of the White House., Tribal loyalties are pretty dug in, though. Trump supporters aren’t going to be swayed by this video – indeed, they can only be nettled by the pageant of liberal-Hollywood aristocrats. Yet the political scene is still reeling from the un-denied story that former US President George Bush Sr is voting for Hillary. I sat down to this video wondering if Whedon had landed any big showbiz Republican converts of his own: Adam Sandler? Kelsey Grammer? Dwayne Johnson? Sly Stallone? James Earl Jones? Aren’t any of them worried about The Donald with his finger on the nuclear button? Obviously getting Clint Eastwood would be unthinkable. Jon Voight would be a coup, though., But no. No defectors. It’s the usual suspects. And given the grave crisis which is approaching – after all, nobody thought Brexit would happen – shouldn’t this video have been more passionate, more explicit, less ironic, less funny even? Or would that have been to overplay its hand? It’s difficult to tell. Maybe the relative reticence is a smart move not looking rattled or scared is obviously a plus, and staying wryly amused by Trump’s absurdity is plausible political body language – the smooth self-possession of movie stars is one way of delivering that mood. Whedon has certainly raised the stakes in advance of the presidential TV debate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.378861\n",
      "Will Smith has criticised Donald Trump and the “absolute collective insanity” of his support., The actor, currently promoting his role in Suicide Squad, spoke about the Republican candidate’s many divisive statements in an interview with news.com.au., “For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary,” he said. “And for people to applaud, that is absolutely fucking insanity to me. My grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if I had referred to a woman as a fat pig. And I cannot understand how people can clap for that. It’s absolutely collective insanity.”, Smith also said that if any of his children said what Trump had about a woman, there would be severe consequences. “If one of my sons – I am getting furious just thinking about it – if one of my sons said that in a public place, they couldn’t even live in my house any more,” he said., The Oscar nominee spoke about his concerns over the “separatist, non-inclusive, xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe” but believes that, ultimately, the US will see sense., “I have faith in America,” he said. “America has had really critical times, but the good [people] tend to make their way to the top.”, Smith is one of many actors speaking out about Trump. More than 120 stars, including Julianne Moore and Lena Dunham, have signed a pledge urging Americans not to vote for him on 8 November.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.362536\n",
      "“What you see on the news is a story 150 years in the making,” says the scrolling text in the first trailer for Ava DuVernay’s The 13th, a documentary about race in America. , The Netflix project examines why the US has produced the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with the majority of those imprisoned being African American. The title of the film refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.”, Beginning with DW Griffith’s technically groundbreaking but profoundly racist 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, The 13th is reported to take in the civil rights movement, the 1994 Crime Bill, which extended the death penalty and encouraged states to lengthen prison sentences, and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement. It makes its debut on Friday at the New York film festival, the first non-fiction film to ever do so. The festival director and selection committee chair, Kent Jones, has said in a statement that The 13th is a “great film” and “an act of true patriotism”., The trailer sets up DuVernay’s documentary as a provocative a mix of archival footage and testimonies from activists, politicians and historians, including Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Van Jones, Newt Gingrich, Angela Davis, Senator Cory Booker, Grover Norquist, Khalil Muhammad, Craig DeRoche, Shaka Senghor, Malkia Cyril and Henry Louis Gates Jr. Hillary Clinton’s controversial “super-predators” remark from a 1996 speech also makes an appearance., The 13th debuts on Netflix and in select theaters on 7 October, DuVernay, best known for directing 2014’s Oscar-nominated Selma, had kept the project a secret from the public during its production.

      "Ava DuVernay’s racial inequality documentary The 13th will open the 54th New York film festival, marking the first time a non-fiction film has been chosen to kick off the event., The Netflix project, which debuts globally on the streaming platform and in select theaters on 7 October, examines why the US has produced the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with the majority of those imprisoned being African American. The title of the film refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.”, A statement reported that “the progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass incarceration and the prison industry in the US is laid out by DuVernay” in the documentary., The film is said to be a mix of archival footage and testimonies from activists, politicians and historians, including Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Van Jones, Newt Gingrich, Angela Davis, Senator Cory Booker, Grover Norquist, Khalil Muhammad, Craig DeRoche, Shaka Senghor, Malkia Cyril and Henry Louis Gates Jr., The festival director and selection committee chair, Kent Jones, said in a statement that The 13th is a “great film”, and also “an act of true patriotism”., DuVernay, best known for directing 2014’s Oscar-nominated Selma, had kept The 13th a secret from the public, until Tuesday’s announcement it’s still not listed on her IMDb page., She’s currently prepping her first big-budget film for Disney, an adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s sci-fi classic A Wrinkle in Time, “about a time-traveling black girl traveling through the universe”. Marvel Studios had courted her to take on Black Panther, but she turned it down in favor of making the family film, which resulted in the blockbuster going to Creed director Ryan Coogler., The festival runs from 30 September to 16 October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.261747\n",

The project, which is intended to run for the duration of the Trump presidency originally took the form of a livestream of people chanting, “He will not divide us”, but the museum was forced to shut it down after less than a month due to it becoming a “flashpoint for violence”., The project was then moved to a cinema in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but was removed following reports of gunshots near the venue. In March, it was moved to an undisclosed location, where it took the form of a flag emblazoned with the project’s title, but alt-right activists defaced the exhibition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.239843\n"

      "Carrie Fisher will appear as Princess Leia in Star Wars: Episode IX, her brother has confirmed., Speaking to the New York Daily News at the opening night gala of the TCM film festival in Los Angeles, Todd Fisher said that he and the late actor’s daughter, Billie Lourd, have given Disney and Lucasfilm permission to use recent footage of Fisher in the film. , “Both of us were like, ‘Yes, how do you take her out of it?’ And the answer is you don’t,” said Todd Fisher. “She’s as much a part of it as anything, and I think her presence now is even more powerful than it was, like Obi-Wan – when the saber cuts him down, he becomes more powerful. I feel like that’s what’s happened with Carrie. I think the legacy should continue.”, Fisher said that he was unsure of the role his sister would play in the film, which has not yet begun filming. “I’m not the only part in that equation, but I think the people deserve to have her,” said Fisher. “She’s owned by them.”, The Daily News report suggests that CGI would not be used to digitally recreate Fisher in the film. In January, Disney was forced to deny rumours that Fisher would be digitally recreated in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, otherwise known as Episode VIII. Previously, the studio had been criticised for recreating the late Peter Cushing’s character of Grand Moff Tarkin in prequel film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. A re-creation of Fisher as a young Princess Leia also appeared in the film., Filming for the as-yet-untitled Episode IX is set to begin this July. Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow will direct the film, due to be released in cinemas on 23 May 2019.

      "Well, the cat is out of the bag. The moggy in question may be knocking on for 40, and the bag is coming apart at the seams, but no matter: the story can finally be told. In 1976, during the filming of Star Wars, Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford, who was Han Solo, crossed over to the Dark Side and – according to Fisher’s new memoir – had a three-month affair. She was 19 with a stormy Hollywood upbringing behind her and a fledgling drug habit he was a 33-year-old former carpenter who was married with two children. According to People magazine, to whom Fisher gave an interview ahead of the publication of her new memoir, The Princess Diarist, it is the news “that die-hard fans have wished for since Han Solo and Princess Leia captured hearts on screen”., This might be an overstatement. It is unlikely that millions of Star Wars disciples have been monitoring the press for the last four decades for an indication that their idols had once been an item. (“Still nothing?” asks the patient wife of a fiftysomething Star Wars enthusiast as he slams the newspaper down on the breakfast table yet again.) Even so, there is a frisson whenever a fictional relationship spills off the edges of the screen like ale into an overfilled tankard., The sexual chemistry between Han and Leia always represented the only authentically adult component of the Star Wars series – and that includes the most recent instalment, The Force Awakens, in which the pair were touchingly reunited. So there is a bizarre vindication to the discovery that it wasn’t merely for the cameras. You almost want to shout: “I knew it!”, But why? Actors are paid to pretend. It’s what they’re good at. Our need to know that it wasn’t really fake, and that we can believe fully in what we saw on screen, suggests either a childlike faith in fantasy (so it was real after all!) or a determination not to be taken for fools (they won’t pull the wool over my eyes!). Revelations like the one about “Carrison” don’t alter the performances. Rather, it’s the romantic equivalent of finding out that an actor really did his or her own stunts. That it wasn’t CGI. That there was risk involved. It mattered., Insights into what happened on set, whether they take the form of nerdy making-of documentaries or salacious tittle-tattle, give us an illusion of intimacy with our idols and enrich the texture of the films we watch. And goodness knows, Star Wars can do with all the enriching it can get. The next time we see the movie, it will be augmented by what we have learned about Ford and Fisher. This won’t make it a better or worse film, and it won’t complicate our experience of it (as darker revelations, such as Tippi Hedren’s recent claim that Hitchcock sexually abused her during the making of The Birds and Marnie, have complicated those pictures). But it will, at best, provide additional context and a smattering of footnotes., To Have and Have Not would always have become a masterpiece, even if Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall had not fallen in love while making it. That they did merely introduces a new prism through which to watch their scenes. So this is what love looks like, we might think, flattering ourselves that we can tell the bona fide from the bogus. Knowing what came next – that Bogart and Bacall remained a couple until the former’s death 13 years later – gives us a privileged foresight and an extra level of emotional investment that could never have been planned or predicted by the film-makers. At the opposite end of the quality spectrum, Cleopatra doesn’t become watchable simply because it brought Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton together for the first of two marriages to each another. But it does mark it out as something other than a kitsch disasterpiece. Burton was 14 years into his marriage to Sybil Williams when he fell for Taylor, who was hitched at the time to Eddie Fisher – Carrie’s dad, no less. Small world., Extracurricular activities don’t change what’s on screen one jot. Mr &amp Mrs Smith is not better than it might otherwise have been simply because it marked the birth of Brangelina, any more than By the Sea is more profound because it foretold Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s demise. At the very least, these matters can be a public relations boon. The new wartime thriller Allied may find a bigger audience than it might ordinarily have done now that it is rumoured to be the film that tore the couple apart. Rumours of an affair between its stars, Pitt and Marion Cotillard, have been comprehensively denied but that doesn’t enter into it. Smoke is good box office. Fire is neither here nor there., • Read an interview with Carrie Fisher and an exclusive extract from The Princess Diarist in Guardian Weekend magazine on Saturday, and on theguardian.com from Sunday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.566407\n",
      "“Mother and I live next door to each other, separated by one daunting hill,” says Carrie Fisher in the HBO documentary Bright Lights, which had its North American premiere at the Telluride film festival on Saturday. “I usually come to her. I always come to her.”, Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens’s cinema verité-style film about Fisher’s close relationship with mother Debbie Reynolds will doubtless draw parallels to Albert and David Maysles’s iconic 1975 documentary Grey Gardens, which centered on a similarly eccentric mother-daughter duo, who shared an equally deep bond. But Fisher likens the film more to a “surreal reality show” featuring “unreal people.”, “I didn’t think that we were the new Grey Gardens,” Fisher said during a conversation after the screening. “It’s really an ideal reality show.”, “My mother and I, we used to go shopping – not a lot, because it would turn into a show,” she continued. “And people would sort of linger because we had loud voices. They would stay in the store to listen us. So [Bright Lights] captures that.”, The film finds Reynolds, now in her mid-80s, on the cusp of retirement and planning one last hurrah variety show in Vegas, much to the chagrin of Fisher, who would rather she rest. “Performance feeds her in ways her family cannot,” says Fisher. She meanwhile is documented in the throes of staging her own comeback, preparing to reprise her role as Princess Leia in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. , “I had always wanted to show my mother off the stage, off the screen, because she’s such an amazing character,” Fisher said. “I wanted someone to capture that.”, Despite her wishes, Fisher admitted that she had “third and fifth thoughts about making it” once Bloom and Stevens came on board, mainly because she’s not fond of her own appearance on screen. , “I don’t like looking at myself,” Fisher said. “I’m just getting bigger and older. That’s not good. Meryl Streep does three movies a year, so she can watch herself age. I went from Princess Leia at 23 in a bikini to this broad. So that was distressing for me. I hate being vain and I’m working on it – and taking classes.”

      "Ghostbusters writer-actor Dan Aykroyd has written a tribute to Carrie Fisher, to whom he was briefly engaged in the early 1980s after they appeared together in The Blues Brothers., Aykroyd’s essay appears in Empire magazine’s farewell to the Star Wars actor, who died in December aged 60. In it, Aykroyd sardonically recalls their meeting and subsequent relationship – “when we were both in our 20s, Carrie and I associated as intimates” – as well as their breakup., In what may not be an entirely serious article, Aykroyd says he met Fisher on TV comedy show Saturday Night Live, but “fell in love” during the making of The Blues Brothers (in which she played a murderous ex-girlfriend of John Belushi’s character, Jake Blues)., Later, he says “we obtained blood tests for compatibility from an East Indian female doctor” and exchanged presents: he gave her a sapphire ring and she gave him a Donald Roller Wilson monkey painting which he “kept for years until it began to frighten my children”., Aykroyd also describes a Christmas they spent together at Lake Tahoe as their “love was soaring on laugh-filled exhilaration and a vibrant, wholly satisfying physical intimacy” they took LSD (“original Owsley [Stanley]”) and “checked in for three days of full-on weeping to Christmas classics”., Aykroyd’s finishes the essay by describing their relationship’s end, which occurred when they moved from Chicago to a new home in Martha’s Vineyard, which Fisher apparently took against. “Carrie wasn’t shallow, we had a great time.” Fisher would reconnect with musician Paul Simon, whom she married in 1983, while Aykroyd married actor Donna Dixon in the same year.

      "Back in the 1970s and 80s, Star Wars fans desperate to fill their time with Jedi-related adventures on mystical far-flung planets in the company of wise, syntactically challenged aliens of the green, hairy-eared variety were forced to turn to comics or novels from the Expanded Universe – or worse still, the execrable Star Wars Holiday Special – while waiting three years for a new film to come out. These days we have thrillingly unnecessary episodes, such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, a Death Star-sized slice of fan fiction masquerading as a movie, to keep appetites whetted. In fact, a new Star Wars movie of a sort is promised every year from here on in, with Alden Ehrenreich’s young Han Solo the next to get his own gap-filling spinoff, in 2018., But now that most fans have seen Rogue One and marveled at its miraculous ability to pump up dozens of minor characters we never knew we cared about into major players on a par with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia et al, we are surely ready to move on to the corners of a galaxy, far, far away that really matter. Star Wars: Episode VIII director Rian Johnson certainly seems to think so, and has been helping to fuel the hype machine with carefully considered hints about part two of the main Star Wars trilogy that began with 2015’s The Force Awakens in a new interview with USA Today. , Solid details are predictably few and far between, but it sounds like Rey’s relationship with Luke Skywalker will form a huge part of the new movie, with Johnson describing their encounter as a deeply affecting “dawning of this new chapter” in the young life of the Jakku-based scavenger. There are also hints that Star Wars’ fondness for inter-generational themes will continue, with the Brick and Looper director revealing familial connections will play “a huge part” in Rey’s story. So far, so tantalizing, but JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens left so many story threads unfinished that there is still plenty more to dig through. Here are some of the questions fans won’t forgive Johnson for failing to answer by the time the credits roll on Star Wars: Episode VIII., Very few of the enduring fan theories about Daisy Ridley’s staff-wielding proto-Jedi are entirely satisfactory. If she is Luke Skywalker’s daughter, why did he abandon his Jedi vows to enter into the relationship that led to her birth? And why does she talk about Anakin Skywalker’s son in excitable, awed terms when he is first mentioned in The Force Awakens, when the natural reaction to someone raising the ongoing absence of your secret dad would surely be pursed lips and sheepish efforts to avoid looking anyone in the eye? For similar reasons, it seems unlikely that Rey is a Kenobi, unless old Ben got really, really bored with hermit-life during his self-imposed 30-year exile on Tatooine and began to engage in unwise forays to Mos Eisley in search of female companionship. Not that he would have had much luck in the sausage fest environment of the local cantina., Trawl the internet for a parsec or two (yes, I know) and you’ll find theories that Rey is the reincarnation of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader – a new chosen one – or that she is Snoke or Palpatine’s literal or metaphorical daughter. The Vader theory would help at least partly to explain the essential quandary surrounding our young hero, that she is somehow stronger with the Force than Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren (who has presumably been honing his darkling emo powers for decades) despite having had no training whatsoever beyond a few years in Luke’s Jedi academy as a very young child. Moreover, why do Rey’s powers emerge so rapidly, and with such raging intensity, when Skywalker’s had to be developed and honed over many years? Only if she is somehow a more powerful Jedi than anything we have seen in Star Wars since the birth of Anakin can any of The Force Awakens’ gaping plot holes be satisfactory filled., The Force Awakens revealed that Skywalker went in search of the first Jedi temple, and that he ended up on the barren, windswept oceanic planet of Ahch-To, where Rey found him in the movie’s final scenes. We also know that Luke failed to stop the young Ben Solo turning to the Dark Side and becoming Kylo Ren, a development which would surely be enough to send even the strongest of minds catapulting into doubt and despair. But there must be more backstory to discover here. , Might Luke have gone into exile to meditate over why his plans to retrain a new generation of Jedi ultimately failed? Is this why he sought out the temple, to wade through ancient repositories of knowledge about the establishment of the original order and work out what went wrong with his own teaching methods? Might the original apex of Jedi knowledge be the only place in the galaxy where it is now possible to communicate with the Force ghosts of past masters? Yoda, Kenobi and even Anakin were seemingly capable of popping up whenever and wherever they pleased in the original trilogy, but Rey was only able to experience fractured, fleeting, half-heard missives from Kenobi at Maz Kanata’s castle, and only when she came within range of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber., Has there been some kind of disturbance in the communication network between living and dead Jedi? This would all make a lot of sense, given the rumours that Frank Oz has been seen on the set of Episode VIII at Pinewood Studios. It would certainly be no surprise to discover in the opening frames of Johnson’s movie that Yoda’s Force Ghost has been keeping Luke company on Ahch-To, and now stands ready to help train a new apprentice., The great thing about Star Wars movies is that inconvenient plot holes can always be explained away by referring to the omnipotency of the Force as a factor in ongoing story development. How did Finn manage to escape General Hux’s battlecruiser, or infiltrate the First Order’s base and capture Captain Phasma, if not for the aforementioned all-powerful mystical energy field guiding him on his path? Why was he even allowed to wield a lightsaber, with some success against trained stormtroopers using melee weapons – and even briefly against Kylo Ren himself – when previous Star Wars movies have never allowed non-Jedi to pick up a laser sword for more than a few seconds? Maz Kanata, who told us she knows a fair bit about Jedi matters, trusted the rogue stormtrooper with the dangerous weapon in the absence of Rey to wield it. Why?, Is Finn, too, in some way Force-sensitive? Or did the team behind The Force Awakens simply choose to sacrifice Star Wars internal logic on the altar of rapid-fire story beats?, Rogue One introduced into the Star Wars universe (at least on the big screen) the concept of Force acolytes who have no Jedi powers themselves, in the form of Donnie Yen’s Chirrut Îmwe. There were heavy suggestions in The Force Awakens that Kanata has a deep knowledge of Force matters, but no explanation whatsoever of how she came into the possession of a lightsaber that once belonged to Anakin Skywalker, and was passed to Luke in 1977’s Star Wars. , This is the laser sword that Luke lost in his Cloud City battle with Vader on the planet of Bespin in The Empire Strikes Back, rather than the one he constructed himself for their final father and son duel in Return of the Jedi. So there is no question of the younger Skywalker having passed the weapon to Kanata before going into exile – he did not have it in the first place. A plaque at a Star Wars display at California’s Disneyland revealed last year that the lightsaber was recovered from the depths of Cloud City by a scavenger, who one assumes must have sold it on to Kanata. So is she merely a renowned collector of old Jedi paraphernalia? That doesn’t seem like a particularly satisfactory explanation., Say what you like about the prequels (and I am far from a fan), but they did at least provide a logical, if bearly watchable, explanation for why Anakin Skywalker turned to the Dark Side: the young Jedi’s fear of losing his wife Padme to the grim reaper, and his growing distrust of the rigid and impassive Jedi Council. But we are a long way from knowing what possible reasons a young apprentice in Luke Skywalker’s school for young Jedis might have had for even listening to the monstrous, waifish, horribly scarred – possibly T-Rex-sized – Snoke. How was Ben Solo groomed, and why did he choose to turn? Did Snoke somehow manage the conversion from across the reaches of space? Or did he infiltrate in some as-yet-unseen, non-threatening guise, perhaps by proxy? , Anakin had a reason – at least initially – to trust Palpatine, the future Emperor, as a trusted, high-ranking politician, the leading light of the Republic in its fight against the separatists in the prequels. What reason could Solo possibly have had to trust Snoke?    0.352600\n",
      "Samuel L Jackson and Star Wars really ought to have been a marriage made in Jedi heaven, if such a knotty metaphysical concept can be presumed to exist. On one side, an actor capable of delivering lines with such force of venom that mere sentences of English crystallise into almighty rhetorical thunderbolts on the other, the greatest space opera saga of all time., But that was before George Lucas decided to cast Jackson as CGI Yoda’s purple lightsabered sidekick Mace Windu, a character so muted and mundane that it is utterly impossible to remember anything he ever said in the execrable prequel films. Don’t believe me? A quick search turned up the following gems. And these are the best ones., You refer to the prophecy of The One who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it’s this boy? , I think it is time we inform the senate that our ability to use the force has diminished. , Our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive., In the grand scheme of things, none of the above has quite the resonance of: “No Luke, I am your father,” “I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” or “Someone who loves you,” all of which are instantly attributable to their respective owners. And there are dozens more lines from the original trilogy I might easily have quoted instead., Windu’s lines could have been spoken by any of the grey, underwritten members of the prequels’ hideously tedious Jedi council (bar Yoda, who would have said them backwards). And that’s because Windu is yet another example of the late-era Lucas penchant for insipidly written identikit characters who exist largely for the purposes of exposition. Windu may have had a few decent lightsaber battles – Jackson was none-too impressed with the quality of Rey and Kylo Ren’s laser sword spats in new episode The Force Awakens – but he is otherwise instantly forgettable., The only really decent roles in the prequels are the baddies, the likes of Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) and the ever-reliable Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine) often mining gold from the distinctly leaden material on offer. But Jackson never got his chance to chew scenery as a nefarious Sith Lord, because Lucas horribly miscast him as a monkish bureaucrat instead., Imagine for a parsec if the Pulp Fiction star had been given the role of a maverick space vagabond, perhaps part-way between Han Solo and Boba Fett. Young Obi-Wan might have been forced to team up with said cosmic ne’er-do-well, at least temporarily, to help him complete a vital mission. But where the original trilogy thrilled us with regular trips to the nearest wretched hive of scum and villainy, the prequels always seemed to prefer the dubious joys of the dreary galactic senate. , Lately Jackson has been dropping hints that Windu might not be dead after all, pointing out that having one’s hand cut off by Anakin Skywalker, being royally Force-blasted by Palpatine and falling from a vast height to one’s death is the kind of ordeal Jedis have easily survived in the past. “In my mind I’m not dead,” he said during a Twitter Q&ampA, before telling Entertainment Weekly: “Of course he is [alive]! And there’s a long history of one-handed Jedi. So why not?”, But is this really somewhere Jackson wants to go? Some fans are now suggesting that a (presumably aged, robot-limbed) Windu might turn up in a future Star Wars movie, perhaps Colin Trevorrow’s Episode IX. After all, JJ Abrams gave Leonard Nimoy’s Spock a wonderfully dignified last hurrah in the Star Trek reboot movies, despite some of the Vulcan’s late 80s big screen appearances (I’m brandishing barbecue tongs in your general direction, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier camping trip) having made Attack of the Clones look like Citizen Kane., Abrams made the wise decision to avoid all reference to Lucas’s later movies in The Force Awakens, bar a brief line of half-heard dialogue recorded by young Kenobi actor Ewan McGregor in Rey’s phantasmagorical flashback scene at Maz Kanata’s castle. Reversing that paradigm when it helped to free the new movie from any lingering resentment toward the prequels would be a sign that Disney is dead set on an entirely unnecessary and deeply disturbing shift back towards the bland side of the Force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.306061\n",
      "This latest exhilarating, good-natured and enjoyable adventure from the Star Wars imaginary universe is written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, and directed by Britain’s Gareth Edwards it comes from a time which now doesn’t seem so very long ago. The film’s action occurs some time between Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV, A New Hope. So it’s a mid-quel or a deja vu-quel. Character archetypes, mythic confrontations, desperate hologram messages, dads real and quasi-, uniforms and hairstyles are always rising recognisably to the surface. Like superhero films or westerns or romcoms, Star Wars invented its own recurring generic components, and to complain or even notice now seems almost as beside the point as recognising familiar chord progressions in the blues. It is noticeable that the newish motif of the defector or renegade, which featured in The Force Awakens, pops up again here., Rogue One has a kind of associate membership status with the projected nine-film club it doesn’t count as a fully fledged episode, but an auxiliary story, an offshoot of the canon, a sleek fighter cruising alongside the main fleet – though of comparable size, shape and manoeuvrability., Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a courageous, fugitive rebel who happens to be the daughter of Galen Erso, the brilliant scientist, designer and Oppenheimer figure behind plans for the Empire’s terrifying new weapon, called a “Death Star”: he is played by Mads Mikkelsen with his familiar air of martyred machismo. Daughter and father endured a terrible trauma Jyn is close to the extremist rebel-dissident Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), and Galen finds himself working for the Empire’s chillingly fanatical administrator, Krennic – a pleasingly unpleasant performance, facially tense and clipped, from Ben Mendelsohn. But whose side is Galen actually on? And when Jyn finds herself destined to steal the Death Star plans and command a rebel ship code-named Rogue One, she must team up with another insurgent, Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna, whose own hidden agenda she realises when it’s almost too late., Felicity Jones is in the tousled-yet-game tradition of Star Wars female leads, like Carrie Fisher or Daisy Ridley: well-born but determined, with a sense of purpose befitting an heiress, if not a princess. The comedy robot this time around is K-2SO, a reprogrammed Empire droid, voiced by Alan Tudyk, who is less obviously dapper than C-3PO. K-2SO is hulking and dark, more like Ted Hughes’s Iron Man in miniature, but with a droll way of objecting to orders his style in backtalk involves a nicely timed deferred punchline. The arms are long, resulting in an almost knuckle-dragging, simian way of walking. In his taciturn way, K-2SO could almost be a quasi-Chewie presence. Elsewhere in the cast, there are signs that, whatever xenophobes like Donald Trump think, China is making a valuable contribution. Other fellow travellers in the rebel world include Baze Malbus, played by Jiang Wen, and Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, who brings a martial artist’s poise to this blind figure who uses his hyper-acute hearing and sense of the Force to negotiate his way around., Rogue One doesn’t really go rogue at any stage, and it isn’t a pop culture event like The Force Awakens, in whose slipstream this appears part of its charm resides in the eerie, almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements, reshuffled and reconfigured, a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future. There are some truly spectacular cameos from much-loved personae, involving next-level digital effects — almost creepily exact, so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine, back to the 80s and 70s., If there is anything new in Rogue One, it is that there is much more of an emphasis on the Death Star’s nuclear effect. In other films, we’ve seen this weapon blow up planets, and the calamity was almost abstract now a prototype is blowing up cities. The implied comparison arguably makes light of a serious subject, but there is a beady-eyed fervency with which Rogue One deploys this catastrophe, and portrays the sacrifice needed to prevent it. Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.260472\n",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has ruled out a run for the US Senate, in response to widespread speculation that the actor would return to political life to take on Donald Trump., Schwarzenegger, who was governor of California from 2003 to 2011, had been tipped by political insiders to enter the 2018 race for the US Senate, either as a Republican or an independent, in a move that would have given him a public platform to oppose Trump’s presidency. However, Schwarzenegger refuted the rumours in a Facebook post published on Sunday, suggesting instead that he would continue his battle against political gerrymandering., “I’m deeply flattered by all of the people who have approached me about running for Senate, but my mission right now is to bring sanity to Washington through redistricting reform like we passed here in California,” he wrote. “Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions., “Thank you for your kind messages and all of the support and I hope you’ll join me in my battle against gerrymandering with the same enthusiasm.”, Schwarzenegger has long been a vocal critic of Trump, supporting Trump’s opponent John Kasich in the Republican primaries and later announcing that he wouldn’t vote for Trump as president, following the release of a widely condemned recording in which Trump boasted about groping women. It was the first time that Schwarzenegger had not voted for a Republican candidate for president since he became a US citizen in 1983., A Twitter feud between the pair has intensified in the weeks following Trump’s swearing in as president. Trump mocked the ratings of his successor as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, and Schwarzenegger suggested in response that the two men should swap jobs, so that “people can finally sleep comfortably again”. , Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice, blaming Trump’s continued involvement in the show, as executive producer, for its poor ratings. Trump in turn claimed in a tweet that Schwarzenegger had not resigned but had been “fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings.... Sad end to great show”.

      "A British firm owned by Disney has been fined £1.6m ($2m) on Wednesday for health and safety breaches after Harrison Ford was crushed by a hydraulic door on the set of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2014., Foodles production company faced sentence today at Aylesbury Crown Court after previously pleading guilty to two counts of breaching its health and safety duties. A court had formerly been told that Ford could have been killed in the incident while filming at Pinewood Studios in London. , On Wednesday, a court was told the door acted like a “blunt guillotine”, coming down “millimeters from his face” as the star passed underneath, pinning him to the ground by the pelvis., The actor sustained severe injuries from the accident, including a broken left leg, after he walked on to the set not believing it to be live. Ford was reprising his role as Han Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens in June 2014 when he was knocked to the ground and crushed beneath the heavy door of the Millennium Falcon while filming at Pinewood Studios in London. , Judge Francis Sheridan said the firm had failed to communicate effectively with Ford: “The greatest failing of all on behalf of the company is a lack of communication, a lack because, if you have a risk assessment and you do not communicate it, what is the point of having one? That is the most serious breach here., “If only they had included Mr Ford in all the discussions, he might have at least been alert to the dangers that he had to avoid,” he added., Ford needed surgery to screw together the fractured tibia and fibula bones in his left leg and plastic surgery on a “deep laceration” to his left hand. , Prosecutor Andrew Marshall recounted how Ford had gone through the door on the set with another actor and hit a button during a second dress rehearsal. Walking back through the door, Ford believed the set was not live and the door would not close because it had not done so during previous rehearsals. , The door was designed to be remotely closed by a special effects operator, who shut it upon a signal from a spotter. Staff were said to have reacted quickly to stop the door from coming down, but ultimately were not fast enough to prevent it closing, stopping at about 90% shut. Marshall said the door was “capable of killing one or possibly two people”., Reading part of Ford’s statement to the court, Marshall said: “The protocol was not followed and the scene was done differently to how it would be if it was to be closed.”, Speaking about the injury to talk-show host Jonathan Ross in December, Ford said the hydraulics involved in the Millennium Falcon had considerably developed since 1977 when the doors were controlled with a pulley operated by hand., Ford said: “Now we had lots of money and technology and so they built a fucking great hydraulic door which closed at light speed and somebody said, ‘Ooh I wonder what this is?’, “And the door came down and hit me on my left hip because I was turned to my right. And then it flung my left leg up and it dislocated my ankle and as it drove me down to the floor, my legs slapped on the ramp up to the Millennium Falcon and broke both bones in my left leg.”, Foodles issued a statement in response to the ruling. “The safety of our cast and crew was always a top priority and we deeply regret this unfortunate on-set accident. The Court acknowledged both the additional safety protocols that were immediately implemented, and that it was a very safe production in all other respects.”, Ford recovered from the injuries in time to complete his portrayal of Han Solo in the film, which took more than $2bn worldwide.

      "The stars of Hidden Figures and Stranger Things were the big winners at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards while political speeches dominated the evening., The cast of the drama based on a true story about three women who played an integral role at Nasa won the big prize of the night for best ensemble in a motion picture. Accepting the award, star Taraji P Henson said: “This story is of unity and this story is about what happens when we put our differences aside ... Love wins.” , One of the film’s stars, Mahershala Ali, won the award for best supporting actor for his role in Moonlight, while Claire Foy and John Lithgow both won dramatic television awards for roles in the Netflix hit The Crown and the cast of Stranger Things won for best ensemble in a drama series., David Harbour, who plays Jim Hopper in the 80s-set adventure, gave a rousing speech on the importance of inclusion. “We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home,” he said. “We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy what we have envisioned for ourselves and the marginalized.” , A visibly upset Ali, who remains the firm favorite to win an Oscar next month, delivered an emotional and topical speech about acceptance. “What I’ve learned from working on Moonlight is seeing what happens when you persecute people,” he said. He talked about converting to Islam yet maintaining a close relationship with his mother, an ordained minister, and begged people to also put aside their religious differences., Emma Stone won the award for best female actor in a lead role for La La Land and after discussing her insecurity in her profession, she spoke about the importance of bringing joy to people given that “we’re in a really tricky time at the moment in our country”. Denzel Washington received the award for best male actor in a leading role for his role in Fences after many predicted Manchester by the Sea star Casey Affleck would win. Washington’s co-star, Viola Davis, was the night’s other big screen winner, named best female actor in a supporting role and she dedicated her award to playwright August Wilson for honoring the average man., Julia Louis-Dreyfus won the award for best female actor in a comedy series for Veep and made jabs at the vote being hacked by the Russians as well as the crowd size at the event itself. She also made a passionate reference to Donald Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration. “This immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American,” she said before reading out an official statement on the matter from the Writers Guild of America., The 37-strong cast of Orange Is the New Black won the prize for ensemble in a comedy series for the third time. Taylor Schilling led a speech that reminded the audience that they represented “generations of people who have sought a better life here”., Sarah Paulson picked up the award for best female actor in a television movie or limited series for The People vs OJ Simpson and gave a plea for people to donate to the ACLU “to protect the rights and liberties of people across this country”. Backstage she added: “Silence is not golden at this time.”, Bryan Cranston, winning for his role as Lyndon B Johnson in the television movie All the Way, also spoke about Trump’s presidency. “I’m often asked how would LBJ think about Donald Trump,” he said. “I honestly feel that 36 would put his arm around 45 and earnestly wish him success and also whisper in his ear something ... ‘Just don’t piss in the soup that all of us gotta eat.’”, John Lithgow’s role as Winston Churchill in breakout Netflix drama The Crown won him the award for best actor in a drama series and after thanking those involved in the show, he also thanked Meryl Streep. He said her Golden Globes speech, where she criticized Trump’s bullying tactics, represented his “exact thoughts”., The awards act as a strong indicator of success at the Academy awards, taking place on 26 February. Earlier this week, La La Land scored 14 nominations while Arrival and Moonlight followed with eight each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.170320\n"

      "0 Ava DuVernay’s racial inequality documentary The 13th will open the 54th New York film festival, marking the first time a non-fiction film has been chosen to kick off the event., The Netflix project, which debuts globally on the streaming platform and in select theaters on 7 October, examines why the US has produced the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with the majority of those imprisoned being African American. The title of the film refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.”, A statement reported that “the progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass incarceration and the prison industry in the US is laid out by DuVernay” in the documentary., The film is said to be a mix of archival footage and testimonies from activists, politicians and historians, including Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Van Jones, Newt Gingrich, Angela Davis, Senator Cory Booker, Grover Norquist, Khalil Muhammad, Craig DeRoche, Shaka Senghor, Malkia Cyril and Henry Louis Gates Jr., The festival director and selection committee chair, Kent Jones, said in a statement that The 13th is a “great film”, and also “an act of true patriotism”., DuVernay, best known for directing 2014’s Oscar-nominated Selma, had kept The 13th a secret from the public, until Tuesday’s announcement it’s still not listed on her IMDb page., She’s currently prepping her first big-budget film for Disney, an adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s sci-fi classic A Wrinkle in Time, “about a time-traveling black girl traveling through the universe”. Marvel Studios had courted her to take on Black Panther, but she turned it down in favor of making the family film, which resulted in the blockbuster going to Creed director Ryan Coogler., The festival runs from 30 September to 16 October. \n",
      "1 It should be pointed out that British bookmakers are not always so powerfully prescient as, say, the Pythian priestesses of the temple of Apollo, or even the mercurially gifted Sybill Trelawney from the Harry Potter books. But the announcement by one (actually Irish) site, Paddy Power, that it sees Suicide Squad’s Margot Robbie as the clear favourite to play a Bond girl in the next 007 movie has nevertheless caused a bit of a stir in the martini-quaffing spy’s homeland., The first question that comes to mind is quite how anyone anywhere knows anything yet about the follow-up to last year’s Spectre, beyond makers Eon, when current 007 Daniel Craig doesn’t seem to be 100% confirmed himself. But perhaps Paddy Power just got bored taking money from those poor fools convinced that the next actor to answer Her Majesty’s Call will be Orlando Bloom or Robert Downey Jr, both as low as 66-1 with some companies. (So, for the record, are Gillian Anderson and Megan Fox, if you’re ready to bet your hard-earned wages on the next Bond being a Jane.), Perhaps the question we really ought to be asking ourselves here is quite how Robbie would benefit from taking the job in the first place. And why, in 2016, playing a “Bond girl” is still seen as the zenith for any up-and-coming female star., It is not as if the long-running spy saga has a fantastic record for creating strong, female partners for MI6’s top man. Of modern-era Bond girls, only Eva Green, as the luminous, multi-layered Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, has really been given the chance to shine as a lover with ongoing resonance for 007’s psyche. In follow-up Quantum of Solace, the Bond writers made a decent stab at couching Olga Kurylenko’s Camille Montes as a different kind of match for 007, but the character is largely forgettable in a vapid entry. Léa Seydoux was fabulous in Spectre as the demure, vulnerable Dr Madeleine Swann. But this was a kind of throwback to the Bond girl of old, where she is always desperately in love with our suave secret agent hero, and usually only valuable as a pawn in the greater game between 007 and his supervillain nemeses., Robbie, it must be said, has played these kinds of roles before. In fact, she has in some form or another portrayed women who are defined almost entirely by their relationships with men in every single one of her major blockbuster outings so far. In The Legend of Tarzan, the Australian actor was Jane to Alexander Skarsgård’s ululating lord of the jungle in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street she was Leonardo DiCaprio’s expensive plaything turned vengeful shrew Naomi Lapaglia, and in the upcoming Suicide Squad she plays Harley Quinn, passionate long-term paramour and partner in crime to Gotham’s clown prince of crime, the Joker. In the trailers, Quinn even wears a jacket sporting the legend: “Property of The Joker”., None of the above is any criticism of Robbie, for these are in many ways fine roles for a young Hollywood actor in 2016. Quinn’s passion for the Joker is a fascinating tale of psychological disturbance, the byproduct of a kind of second cousin to Stockholm syndrome. Lapaglia gets her own back in the end, even if she is presented initially as a preposterously stereotyped figure of male fantasy, the ultimate marriage-wrecking younger model. , And neither is this article intended as a kind of Bechdel test-brandishing diatribe against rigid Hollywood gender hierarchies. In the era of brilliant TV such as Orange is the New Black it is simply rather tedious to see one of our finest young female stars being pitched for parts that closely resemble every “love interest” role seen on the big screen for the past 50 years., It would be nice to think that Robbie has also passed the stage where she needs to take these kind of parts. You would not see Jennifer Lawrence, admittedly an Oscar winner, signing up to play a Bond girl. And surely The Hunger Games saga, while by no means perfect by the end, proved if nothing else that female-led blockbusters are just as vital components in the Hollywood machine as spy movies and comic-book epics., If Robbie really is being offered a role in Bond, we can only assume that studios see her rather more like that guy who wrote the Vanity Fair article about the Australian star’s ability to be “sexy and composed even while naked”. And rather less like we’d have to very much hope the rest of the world does.\n",
      "2 Ira Sachs’s Little Men is a beautifully acted generational drama, a coming of age, boy’s own story of lost friendship and a pessimistic satire about gentrification – all composed with scrupulous observational care., Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Ehle play Brian and Kathy, a decent if somewhat self-pitying guy and his wife. Brian is an actor whose career is dying, and when he inherits a property in Brooklyn from his late father there is a chance for some real financial stability. He realises he is within his rights to hike the rent being charged to the woman who has a dress shop in the downstairs apartment., But the exquisitely painful problem – quite aside from their liberal middle-class embarrassment at needing or wanting to do this – is that the woman’s son has befriended their son, and saved him from loneliness. Brian and Kathy actually owe this woman a lot. But Brian also owes something to his sister, who has her own money worries, and they overwhelmingly feel that they owe themselves a fair bit as well., It is an agonising anatomy of divided loyalties, made much more poignant and real by the lovely performances of Michael Barbieri and Theo Taplitz as the two teenagers whose friendship continues alongside, or above, the adults’ undignified wrangling over money. There is something quietly and intimately tragic about how this relationship pans out, and their final scene together is haunting. \n"

      "3 Angelina Jolie is expected to take on the role played by Lauren Bacall in Murder on the Orient Express, in an upcoming remake of the 1974 classic, directed by Kenneth Branagh., Branagh’s film, like Sidney Lumet’s original, is based on Agatha Christie’s 1934 mystery novel, which revolves around special detective Hercule Poirot and his efforts to solve a murder case aboard the famous train., Branagh will star as Poirot, played by Albert Finney in Lumet’s adaptation. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Jolie is in final talks to portray Mrs Harriet Hubbard, one of the passengers who’s deemed a suspect., The rest of the ensemble has yet to be announced – but expect it to be star-packed. On top of starring Finney and Bacall, Lumet’s film also featured Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery., Shooting is expected to begin in November, with locations including London and Malta. Green Lantern writer Michael Green penned the screenplay., Jolie has appeared on the big screen only intermittently in recent years, and has suggested that she plans to move permanently into directing. Last year, Jolie directed herself, alongside husband Brad Pitt, in the arthouse relationship drama By the Sea. Coming up, she’s slated to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney’s sequel to the 2014 box-office smash., Jolie also recently helmed the upcoming Netflix documentary, First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, based on Cambodian author and human rights activist Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir., Fox will release Branagh’s take on Murder on the Orient Express 22 November 2017, during the heat of awards season.\n",
      "4 Matthew McConaughey is insufferably hammy and tiresomely self-regarding in this shapeless, unsatisfying movie, taken from a real-life South Sea Bubble case of credulity and greed. But the film has neither the steel and wit necessary for satire, nor the insight for an engaging human drama in the style of something like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Finally, McConaughey’s smug hero makes an unearned claim on our sentimental affections he is the roistering entrepreneur who wants to be both the victim of a fraud yet somehow also its lovably cheeky beneficiary. Moreover, McConaughey has zero bromantic chemistry with his co-star, Edgar Ramírez, who phones in a dull, blank performance., The story is based on a 1990s mining scandal: a phoney claim to have found gold in Indonesia created a stock-market tulip fever based on nothing. McConaughey plays Kenny Welsh, a veteran mining engineer who is staring failure and poverty in the face then a visionary dream tells Kenny to look for gold in Indonesia, where he bankrolls an exploratory drill by geologist Michael Acosta (Ramírez), who assures him they have hit paydirt. All sorts of greedy bankers and players get involved, and Kenny’s stock price goes through the roof. But Acosta may have lied to everyone, including Kenny. McConaughey’s grandstanding is not as charming as he thinks it is, and can’t put any life or interest into this stodgy film.\n",
      "5 No one, in all honesty, would go to the best picture Oscar list for a defining rundown of the best American cinema. Too many short-shelf life films get through the voting process and rise to the top: Crash? A Beautiful Mind? Really? Middling-to-decent tends to triumph. Actual dyed-in-the-wool classics are rare: The Deer Hunter and The Godfather, and possibly No Country for Old Men and Birdman, are among the only highlights of the past five decades., Then there’s The Sting (1973). Made at the crest of the Hollywood new wave, it may not be freighted with the state-of-American-society themes that weighted Coppola’s or Cimino’s films, nor the embedded cynicism that have made the Coens and Alejandro González Iñárritu beloved in a later cinematic era. But The Sting is the most purely enjoyable film in Oscar history – and that, I think, puts it in the most valuable American film-making tradition of all., First and foremost, The Sting is simply a great caper movie. It wasn’t the first, of course – the convoluted-robbery film was a popular genre throughout the 1960s – but it’s got to be the most complicated brainteaser ever to reach blockbuster and major awards status. In fact, it disproves the idea that popular movies have to be dumb maybe it’s just a peculiarity of the caper genre, but The Sting is as knotty as a differential equation. Its two-part narrative structure – first the card game on the train in which Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) outmanoeuvres nasty Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) and then the betting-office scam that ends with Hooker (Robert Redford) and Gondorff getting plugged – pleasingly follows the pattern of the old bait-and-switch itself. , The elaborate skill of the main scam – “the wire” – is still a delight, nearly 40 years on. It’s a beautifully stage-managed sequence, as Gondorff and Hooker exploit the time delay of the ticker-tape machine (cutting-edge tech in the mid-30s, you presume). As with Argo, Now You See Me and Ocean’s Eleven, The Sting has a sense of the pleasure of a skilfully delivered performance (I’m personally enamoured of Tom Spratley’s “Me specialty’s an Englishman”). There is something about the pride in actorly craftsmanship, underlying cinema’s fondness for cons, stunts and heists. , And The Sting doesn’t neglect to deal with suspension-of-disbelief issues. Cruder films would have had Hooker and Gondorff high-fiving each other as Lonnegan looked on, appalled, but The Sting inserts a final coup de grace – the row, the shooting – that is necessary to get Lonnegan out of the building with no possibility of revenge. But it’s so adroitly done that, until you know for sure, it looks as if Hooker and Gondorff might actually be going at it for real. , Some of the film’s brilliancies are purely decorative. That instantly identifiable theme, for example – Scott Joplin by way of Marvin Hamlisch – is still one of the all-time earworms, and I always find it funny that, despite all the chalkstripe suits and carefully titled caps, the film still looks more like the 1970s than the 1930s. Plus, it’s got one of the great movie bromances in Redford and Newman, one refreshingly free of machismo and manly bluster. The pair had already established their double act in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid four years earlier. It was a triple act if you include the director George Roy Hill, with whom they were reunited on The Sting, and who seems to have inexplicably fallen from critical attention in subsequent years., But best of all, The Sting is a wonderfully moral movie – if that’s not a contradiction in terms for a story of rank deception. It’s more than a simple display of distraction-technique fireworks there is sensitive narrative drama at the heart of the film. These are the deadbeat little guys banding together and putting one over on the vicious, flint-hearted, mean-minded man at the top. (Suddenly, it feels very topical.) Modern cinema could learn a lot.\n"

      "6 Since the majority of the buzz surrounding Paul Feig’s new female-led Ghostbusters has focused on the man-babies angry about gender, we haven’t spent enough time praising the choice of leads., Kristen Wiig has mostly stuck to indie-based supporting roles since breaking out in 2011’s Oscar-nominated Bridesmaids, but playing the awkward academic with a paranormal past in this week’s big budget sci-fi comedy takes her back to the multiplex. The film might underwhelm in parts but she remains a winning comic presence throughout., But what have been her greatest roles?, Wiig had been part of Saturday Night Live for two years when she made her first memorable big-screen appearance. It’s a minor role in Judd Apatow’s engaging romantic comedy, but in a small amount of screen time she emerged as an effortless scene-stealer. As the snippy E! employee with limited social skills, she turned every glance into a punchline., Her magnum opus arrived in 2011 with a film that finally gave her the lead she deserved. The Paul Feig-directed comedy, which Wiig co-scripted, still stands out as a game-changer. It’s a smart, beautifully observed, painfully funny film about female friendship and difficult-to-admit selfishness that made more money than any other offering from the Apatow stable. Wiig’s excellent performance teeters on mania throughout., Post-Bridesmaids, Wiig has largely avoided big-budget fare, with mixed success. Her first smart choice came in 2014 when she teamed up with her ex-SNL co-star Bill Hader. They played siblings who reconnect after years apart and, thanks to the history between the pair off-screen, there’s a genuine lived-in chemistry that brings an added dimension to the modest drama., Her next lead role provided a rather difficult challenge: playing a woman with borderline personality disorder who uses her lottery winnings to fund a talk show. The film itself is uneven and could be accused of using mental illness for laughs, but Wiig is tremendous throughout, playing on her inherent awkwardness for both humour and pathos., While she might have the least screen-time of the central trio in Marielle Heller’s impressive debut, Wiig still leaves her mark in this 70s-set drama. She plays the hard-partying mother of Bel Powley’s titular teen, and paints a tragic figure of a woman disappointed with how her life has turned out.\n",
      "7 Before this year’s Cannes film festival, the idea of a new Paul Verhoeven thriller was undeniably intriguing but hardly the suggestion of a sure thing. The once infamous film-maker has been rather quiet since 2006’s Black Book and, as much fun as it is to get drunk and rewatch Showgirls, it’s still a remarkably awful and hilariously self-serious piece of work., Elle was predicted to be nothing but a curio, tagged on to the end of a festival filled with more obvious surface-level substance and pomp. But it turned out we were all underestimating what perverted pleasures he had in store. How on earth could we have prepared for something quite so brazen and demented as Elle?, Admittedly, a clue was in the casting. Isabelle Huppert, whose work with Michael Haneke alone shows that she is unafraid to cross, stab and confess sickening desires to the line, is given free rein to deliver a staggeringly bold performance. In a film that covers infidelity, violent rape, spousal abuse and mass murder, she retains an icy control over the mayhem and, along with a zinger-filled script from David Birke (from Philippe Djian’s novel), ensures riotous laughter throughout., As well as providing her the opportunity to give a career-best turn, Elle also reminds us of Verhoeven’s untempered ability to confound and delight. His film is entirely, stubbornly unapologetic in its devious amorality, delivering cattle-prod shocks without warning and offering up 2016’s most compelling “nasty woman”., • More best films of 2016 in the US\n",
      "8 There are many reasons to criticise James Cameron’s record-breaking weepie Titanic but one of the most frustrating reminders of its success lies in Hollywood’s repetitive treatment of historical tragedies ever since. Not that the director invented the formula of placing a love triangle in the middle of adversity, but he showed that it could be extraordinarily profitable – and movies from Pearl Harbor to Pompeii have tried desperately to replicate the package., Hotel Rwanda director Terry George has found himself another devastating, and far less covered, genocide to focus on, but in order to warrant the extravagant scale, a romantic trio has been placed front and centre. The film starts in Armenia in 1914 and follows Michael (Oscar Isaac), a man working in an apothecary, who dreams of becoming a doctor. But to afford the fees, he gets betrothed to a local woman and uses the dowry to go to school in Constantinople. Once he arrives, he quickly falls for Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) but – you guessed it – she’s already in a relationship. Her boyfriend is the fiery Chris (Christian Bale), an American journalist reporting on the growing tensions between Turkey and Armenia. As Michael and Ana get closer, war breaks out and the three find themselves in the middle of a terrifying situation., There’s something rather dusty about The Promise as George pushes his characters through a string of soapy machinations that feel incredibly familiar. But there’s also something rather comfortingly reliable about it as well and, while a tad workmanlike, his solid direction ensures that the drama is mostly involving. It also helps that the Armenian genocide is a relatively unexplored period of history and makes for a horrifying backdrop. , Subtlety isn’t the film’s strong point – with certain lines of dialogue (“I’m going to slaughter everyone on this mountain!”) proving to be hilariously on the nose and Bale forced into some rather hammy scenes of rage. Isaac fares a little better and it’s refreshing at least for his character not to be a natural born fighter (there’s one rather nicely observed scene where he struggles to load a gun) but his chemistry with Le Bon is nonexistent. This proves to be problematic given the film’s focus on romance, and one does wish that there were more context provided to the conflict itself and a wider view of the atrocities taking place. , But rather like Russell Crowe’s similarly creaky directorial debut The Water Diviner last year, there’s something to enjoy about its traditional brand of storytelling, devoid of any irony. There are definitely more interesting and satisfying films to be made about the Armenian genocide and this is never going to become a Titanic-sized success – but it’s a solid, if overly soapy, drama.\n"

      "9 For Jessica Chastain, there’s a constant trait found in her best roles: the characters she plays are obsessive. In Zero Dark Thirty she played the female operative behind locating Osama bin Laden. Those obsessive qualities were also found in Crimson Peak’s Lucille Sharpe, as well as Anna Morales, the Lady Macbeth-type in A Most Violent Year. But Elizabeth Sloane, the tenacious lobbyist she plays here, is perhaps her most obsessive character yet., Director John Madden (reuniting with Chastain following 2010’s The Debt) opens on a lucid Sloane peering directly into the camera. “Lobbying is about foresight,” she says. “Anticipating your opponent’s moves and devising counter-measures. I was hired to win.” From the outset of Miss Sloane, first-time screenwriter Jonathan Perera establishes Sloane as a fighter with laser-like focus on her prize., In what we come to learn is a flash-forward, Sloane is seen defending herself in a Senate hearing. The sequence eerily calls to mind Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi hearing, with Sloane soldiering on as the committee, led by an incensed Democratic legislator (John Lithgow), tear into her. The destabilizing introduction gives way to a main narrative that recounts the circumstances that planted Sloane in this scenario., Months before being called before the Senate, Sloane fed off her reputation as one of the most powerful players behind the scenes in Washington. Chastain plays her as a woman who relishes the threat she poses to her adversaries, fully owning her worth in a similar way to Scandal’s political fixer Olivia Pope. Sloane might not run the old-school lobbying firm where she works (it’s headed by George Dupont, played by Sam Waterston), but she paces the office in her designer stilettos like she owns the joint., When the head of a powerful gun lobby calls on her to help convince women to oppose a bill that will impose new regulations on the sale of firearms, Sloane ridicules his pitch by laughing him out of the building. Sloane, it turns out, has a moral compass. She also sees the threat as an opportunity. Confident she has what it takes to uphold the bill, Sloane switches over to a scrappy boutique firm to fight the opposition., Sloane is equal parts crusader and manipulator. She staves off any semblance of a personal life to push forward at work. Sex to Sloane is purely transactional – she pays for it, and shuts down any emotional advances from her male escorts., With another actor in the part, Sloane could have come across as a stereotype: a robotic workaholic with no interior life. Chastain overcomes Perera’s at times crass characterization by imbuing her with an undercurrent of melancholy. Sloane never outrightly expresses that she regrets the path she’s chosen. But watching Chastain, it’s apparent that Sloane is unhappy., As the stakes get higher for Sloane and her group of young junior lobbyists who report to her with a mixture of admiration and fear, she resorts to suspect means to stay one step ahead of the opposition. Her end goal, however, is always admirable., Chastain tackles this challenging paradox by playing Sloane for who she is: tough, driven and uncompromising. The warmth that earned Chastain her first Oscar nomination for The Help is stripped away. As Sloane, Chastain’s only smiles are self-satisfied ones. The actor doesn’t sweat to earn sympathy it’s Sloane’s tenacity that demands it. It’s a brave approach, and it works., That central performance makes Miss Sloane compulsively watchable even as Perera’s script grows increasingly ludicrous in its final stretch (the film runs an unwieldy 132 minutes). What was first a lean thriller morphs into twist-filled jumble, resembling the John Grisham novels Sloane reads before going to bed. Chastain single-handedly prevents it all from veering off the rails by dominating Miss Sloane with her forceful presence. She grounds her heroine to ensure you’re with her.\n"
